Our professional web scraper service can help you get the maximum advantage from our services by rotating IP addresses, automatic CAPTCHA solving, and much more Many e-commerce businesses and local businesses need data to learn about market trends, understand what preferences customers have, and identify how competitors are strategizing. With web scraping, an automated process used to extract data that businesses use to achieve their business goals, you can not only collect information but also use it for search and market analysis. Many businesses take advantage of competitors’ public data using web scraping and obtain this data and store it in another storage partition for later analysis. Although some types of web scraping are considered illegal by the cyber security laws of different countries in order to ensure the privacy of some information. Also, many website owners try to prevent web scraping and theft of their data by creating difficulties. Scrape.do will solve your project for you at a very cheap price. Our professional web scraper service can help you get the maximum advantage from our services by rotating IP addresses, automatic CAPTCHA solving, and much more. We are dedicated to providing the highest quality of service backed by our professionalism and experience on all the projects we work on together. Is Web Scraping Legal? If you do not use the data obtained as a result of web scraping for unethical purposes, web scraping certainly does not become an illegal activity. Businesses have also been known to extract publicly shared data to stay competitive and get ahead of other companies. Although this method is being sued by data owners and websites, the judges certainly did not find it illegal and did not qualify it as federal hacking. In addition to all these, the use of scraped data can sometimes cause direct or indirect copyright infringement. In this case, as in the Facebook and Power Ventures case, web scraping can be found to be illegal. So doing web scraping or using web scrapers for that is actually not illegal. Illegal situations have been revised in the last 10 years with privacy regulations such as General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). What are the Data Scraping Challenges? While discussing whether web scraping is legal or not, we mentioned in which situations you may run into illegal problems. Apart from these, web scraping tools are known to face many different challenges. A large part of these difficulties is technical and barriers provided by the website owner. In this section, we will talk with you about bot access, IP blocking, CAPTCHA, Honeypot Traps, various web page structures, login requirements, dynamic data, and data issues from multiple sources. If you’re ready, let’s start. What is a Bot Access Problem? A robots.txt file is included in the source files of websites to manage what a web browser and a web scraper can do and set what activities are allowed. In order to access the URL address and content on the website, the robots.txt file must allow you access, if you do not have access, you will not be able to access the URL address or the content. The robots.txt file, which can communicate with search engine crawlers, will tell you which URL addresses should be accessed in order to prevent websites from getting more load. If you want to scrape a website with a robots.txt file, the web scraper bot will check the robots.txt file to see if the content is crawlable. The information written in this file will contain information about the bot’s browsing limit in order to prevent congestion on the website and not prevent other users from accessing it. The website, on the other hand, will block a web scraper after detecting it in the robots.txt file. The web page will still show up in the search results, but there will be no description at the time of it, i.e. exe files, video files, PDFs and other non-HTML files will become inaccessible. In this case, the web scraper will not be able to scrape the URL addresses and content obscured by the robots.txt file, and it will be impossible for you to automatically collect data using a web scraper bot. What is an IP Blocking Problem? An IP blocking issue can occur if the proxy spends more time scraping a website than necessary and anticipated. In this case, the network service’s scraper will block the bot’s IP address and the entire subnet. If the request is coming from the same IP address extremely frequently, the website will know that these requests came from a crawling bot. You will also not be able to scrape the website after a while, as you also leave a clear footprint where you automate HTTP/HTTPS requests during web scraping. Website owners can also prevent an IP address from accessing data by detecting which IP addresses are scraping from binary log files based on the number and frequency of requests. It makes sense to review this rule as each website may have a different rule about allowing or blocking their data from scraping. For example, although a website may have a threshold of 100 requests per hour from the same IP address, for some websites this content may be 50. Some countries may prohibit access to websites from a different country, in which case you may be banned depending on your geographic location. You may not be able to access many websites because your IP address indicates your location. The biggest reason for this situation may be that a government, business, or organization imposes some sanctions, such as imposing restrictions on accessing websites. At the same time, a large part of these restrictions is measured to prevent hacking and phishing attacks. What is a CAPTCHA Problem? CAPTCHA , a fully automated public Turing test to understand Computers and Humans Apart, has questions and some puzzles that humans can easily solve but web scraper bots cannot easily solve. Since bots cannot solve these puzzles, it is also possible to characterize them as a kind of website security measure that separates humans from bots. In addition, CAPTCHA prevents bots from creating fake accounts and sending spam messages to the registration website. In addition to all these benefits, it prevents web scrapers from purchasing large numbers of tickets to resell and on the black market, it also prevents these bots from making false registrations for free events. When using CAPTCHA, also prevents bots from making false and inaccurate comments. CAPTCHA, which also prevents spamming on message boards, contact forms or review sites, identifies bots better than other systems and blocks bots from accessing websites, so it’s a serious risk for web scraping. However, there are also many CAPTCHA solver services you can use to constantly scrape, avoid any obstacles, bypass the CAPTCHA test, and allow bot access. While these solver services will help you bypass CAPTCHA blocks and allow you to collect data unhindered, all of this will slow down the web scraping process. What Is The Honeypot Traps Problem? Honeypots, which describe and see themselves as a vulnerable system targeted by attackers on the internet, can be software and networks, as well as servers, routers, or high-value applications. Honeypots, which we can define as any source, can be operated by any computer in the network. The purpose of these applications is to deliberately present themselves as compromised on the network so that attackers can exploit them. By exploiting the Honeypot system, it is possible to detect whether the attackers are real computers on the network. In addition, these honeypots, which seem very legitimate, can manage to detect your bots through some traps. One of the traps used by the Honeypot system is the links that scrapers can easily detect and click on, but cannot be seen by real users. In the Honeypot application, the bot will learn from the bot’s code how the website is or can be evaded as soon as it is trapped. The honeypot system, which examines the code of the bot, will be able to create a stronger firewall on its own to prevent such scraping bots from logging into websites. What is a Miscellaneous Web Page Structure Problem? It is known that most website owners design websites both in line with the needs of their business and taking into account the needs of the users. Each website has its own page design method, and in addition to these, website developers are known to update website pages to add new features to the website and improve the user experience. Frequent structural changes to website pages will be a serious challenge for a web scraper. The website owner should use HTML tags while designing a website, and the page is created in line with these tags. While designing web scraping tools, HTML tags and elements are used to design web scraper tools. So, if the page structure of a website changes, or even the slightest change, it becomes impossible to scrape that website using the same web scraping tool. If you want to scrape an updated web page, you will have to create a completely new web scraper. What is the Login Requirement Problem? Because some websites require you to log in, scraper bots may not be able to scrape the website. In this case, the web scraper bot needs some necessary credentials to scrape the website. Logging in can be easy or difficult, depending on how severe the security measures the website has put in place. Considering that the login and the sign-up page is a simple HTML form asking for username, email, and password, a bot will easily fill out this form if it has the necessary information. Immediately afterward, an HTTP POST request containing the form’s data will be sent to the URL address directed by the website, and immediately after the server processes the data and checks the credentials, the bot will be able to be redirected to the home page. Immediately after your login credentials are sent to the website’s server, the browser will add a different diagnostic value to various requests running on other sites, so the website will know that you are the one who logged in before. However, the login requirement is not a serious challenge and is a problem that can be easily solved with the help of small codes, you can also characterize this problem as one of the stages of data collection. What is Dynamic Data Scraping Problem? Many businesses consider web scraping to be an important operation as they work on data. In addition, many businesses have a lot of work to do with price comparison, inventory tracking, credit scores, etc. It also needs to take advantage of real-time data. As this data is vital for many websites, it is essential for a web scraper bot to collect this real-time data as quickly as possible to help a business realize the largest capital gains possible. Web scraping tools must constantly monitor websites for changing data and have a high level of availability to scrape those websites. What is the Problem of Data from Multiple Sources? Data is not difficult to access as data is ubiquitous. The challenge will be to collect the data, continue this data collection and find the data in the format you want. Since it is not possible to provide these at the same time, the bot working as a web scraper should be able to extract data in the form of HTML tags or PDF format from all websites, mobile applications, and all other devices. Each data source has its own characteristics, including social data, machine data, and transaction data. For example, social data consists of data that includes customers’ or users’ likes, comments, shares, uploads, and people they follow, almost all social data comes from social media websites. Thanks to this data, it becomes possible for businesses to get an idea about customer behavior and attitudes and make a marketing strategy. Machine data, on the other hand, is data that web scraper bots scrape from equipment, sensors, and weblogs that examine user behavior. Data in this subset of data can be output from real-time devices such as medical equipment, surveillance cameras, and satellites, and such data is increasing day by day. When you want to review transaction data, you see daily purchases, invoices, warehousing, and deliveries. This data will give you more information about the buying habits of your customers or your competitors’ customers and will give you a chance to make smart decisions.

If you have a lot of websites to scrape and you want to perform a large-scale web scraping, it requires you to build a powerful and scalable web scraping infrastructure. If you want a powerful and scalable web scraping infrastructure, you will also need an advanced system and meticulous planning. If you have an idea of ​​how you can perform web scraping, you can easily master the things we will talk about in this article, but if you do not have any experience and ideas, you will first need to get a team of experienced developers, you need to let these developers set up infrastructure for you, of course, you will also pay them. If you’ve hired a web developer team and you’re confident they’ll set up the infrastructure for you, you shouldn’t worry much, but you still need to do a rigorous round of testing just before you start extracting data no matter what. Let’s talk, though, that the hardest part is actually creating the scraping infrastructure. If the infrastructure you have built for web scraping is not well thought out and tested, it can cause multiple problems and you may also face legal issues. For this reason, in this article, we will share with you how solid and well-planned web scraping should take place and what needs to be done. Just before we begin, we want you to know that if you need a good web scraping team, we at Scrape.do will always be happy to work for you.

Get Started By Creating Auto-scraping Spiders If you want to scrape websites in bulk, you need to set up some kind of automated script. This script is often called a spider, and these automated scripts are critical. Each spider must be capable enough to create multiple threads. In addition, it is important that the spiders you create can act independently in order to easily crawl more than one website. Let’s reinforce and understand this situation with an example. Let’s say you want to scrape data from an e-commerce-based website, let’s also imagine that this website has multiple subcategories such as books, clothing, watches, and mobile phones. When you reach the root website, the e-commerce site itself, you need four different spiders. One of these spiders must search for books, another for clothes, another for watches, and the last for cell phones. If you can’t program a single spider to mutate into multiple spiders, you’ll need a new spider to access every category on a website, which is an irrational and time-consuming activity to continually reproduce spiders. When you ensure that each of the spiders you have is separated within itself, you can scan the data one by one. In addition, if there is an exceptional case that is not caught and any of these spiders crash, you can continue your scraping one by one without having to interrupt your other spiders. When your spiders are divided among themselves, you also ensure that your data is always renewed, and you can scan at certain time intervals thanks to your spiders. You can also scrape the web using the spiders you have, only on certain dates and times according to your needs. How to Manage Your Spiders Now that you understand what spiders are and how they should work, the next thing you need to know to run a large web scraping project is how to manage your spiders. If you want to better manage your spiders you may need to create an abstraction above your spiders. When you look at the search engine results pages, it is possible to find more than one spider management platform. While which platform you choose depends entirely on the features you want and your budget, the overall purpose of these platforms is to schedule jobs, review received data, and automate spiders. By using one of the spider management platforms, it becomes possible to keep up to date with the status of your web scraping project without even having to manage your servers. You Should Do Javascript Rendering Although Javascript, which is widely used on modern websites and can be encountered frequently, is an extremely innovative technology, it will be a disadvantage for you if you are running a web scraping project. If the data on the website you want to scrape is data processed with the help of Javascript, you can be sure that your web scraping project will be more complex. However, if you manage to pass the data from the backend to the front end of the website with the help of AJAX calls, you can inspect the website and simulate the AJAX request your spider has to get the JSON/XML file. In this case, the data you want will be yours whether Javascript is used or not. If the content on a website is created using Javascript and you have noticed this, the first thing you should do is find a headless browser like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright. If you are trying to go through antibots and do web scraping despite antibots, using a headless browser will be necessary. If you use headless browsers, you can generate Javascript in the short term and get the data much faster, but you should keep in mind that using headless browsers will require much more hardware resources in the long run. If the hardware resources used are as important to you as the management time, you should first examine the website properly and find out that there are no AJAX calls or hidden API calls in the background. If there is no other way to get the data and you need to use Javascript anyway, then you can get help from a headless browser. You Should Validate Your Data and Control the Quality of Data Although web scraping may seem like it means collecting data and dumping it into another document, this is definitely not the case. If you don’t want dirty data to be in your datasets and don’t want to waste your time getting useless data, you need validations and controls to make sure your data is of good quality. If certain data points have gaps and you need to scrape data to fill those gaps, you must set constraints for each data point. For example, you can specify only a certain number of digits for phone numbers, and specify only as a difference whether it contains numbers or not. For nouns, you can check if they are made up of one or more words and do not qualify as nouns that are not separated by spaces. With just a few steps like this, you can prevent dirty, corrupt, and useless data from leaking into your data column. If you have decided to complete your web scraping framework, as a first step you need to research which websites have the maximum data accuracy, after doing very important research in this area you will be able to get better results and not need manual intervention in the long run. In addition, one of the biggest problems with scraped datasets is the large number and abundance of duplicate data. If you want to obtain a large amount of data, it is also essential to check if your data is duplicated. In addition, this way you not only keep your dataset clean but also reduce the storage requirement of your data. In this way, you will both have quality data and spend less money. If you want to keep your scraping data cleaner and more accurate, you have to choose a more difficult and effective way. This is scanning data from more than one source and testing the similarity of the data to each other. You should also keep in mind that this method may take more time and may be difficult to set up for each data set you fill out. However, if you want to have a clean web scraping, this is the best method you can choose. You Should Find and Use A Scalable Server for Web Scraping If there is mention of spiders and automated scripts, it is also mentioned somewhere that these automated scripts and spiders usually need to be deployed on a cloud-based server. So if you have spiders and automated scripts it’s extremely important to find a scalable server where you can store them. Let us recommend AWS-EC2 from Amazon, one of the most widely used and cheapest solutions. This server is managed by teams at AWS and is routinely maintained at regular intervals. So you can run code on a Linux or Windows server. There are 275 different types of services that Amazon will offer you, and which of these servers you choose depends on the type of operating system, how you want your server to be managed, and what type of CPU and RAM it will use. Since you are only charged for the time you run the server, you will not be charged extra even if you stop using it completely after a certain time. By setting up your scraping infrastructure on a cloud server, you will be managing an effective web scraping project for much less money in the long run. But keep in mind that you may also need the architects managing your instance to set up things for your server and upgrade or make changes as needed. You Should Keep the Data You Have Obtained and Store it for Later Use If you are managing a web scraping project, in addition to the infrastructure and code required to extract the data, you also need a storage area where you can access the data you have obtained at any time. When you manage this storage properly, you will also be able to store your data in a format or location for use together. If you’re scraping large images and videos that require almost GBs of storage and want to store this high-resolution data, you can take advantage of AWS-S3, the cheapest data storage solution on the market today. In addition to this system, which is also a solution of Amazon, you can also take advantage of more expensive solutions that you can choose depending on how often you want to access the data. You Should Use Proxy Management and IP Rotation Service While if you want to scrape a single web page it is possible to get the job done by running the script from your laptop, if you are trying to crawl data from thousands of web pages of a website every second, your IP address will be blacklisted or blocked from the website altogether. If you scan too much and manage to automatically recognize and fill CAPTCHA services, the website may block your IP address and you will also be blocked from encountering CAPTCHA. You can use a VPN or Proxy service to constantly change your IP address. You can also set the intervals at which your IP address will change and in which locations your IP address will be located. The user-agent is an important tool that not only tells you which browser to use but also tells you which operating system that browser is running on. If the information in this tool stays with you for a long time, the website will easily detect that you are trying to scrape your data and will block you. For this reason, you will need to keep rotating your user agent and the IP address from time to time. You should consider creating a list of your user agents and randomly selecting one after a fixed time interval. If you want to avoid being blacklisted, you should take advantage of tools like Selenium and use a headless browser. The most important thing to keep in mind is that running a headless browser is almost the same as using a regular browser, except you don’t see the pages visually, but using a headless browser will still extremely resource intensive. Using a headless browser will be resource intensive, so if you are using cloud systems your process will be slower and you will run a more expensive web scraping project. See our proxy services in detail. If you do not want to deal with web scraping components and want to get a web scraping service where you have almost everything you need, you should contact scrape.do, that is, us. You will be able to carry out a web scraping project without dealing with any technical knowledge, with prices suitable for every budget we can offer you. ‍ ‍"},

Gain valuable insights from websites and automate data extraction for various applications.", "h1": "How to Scrape Data with Python? Build Python Web Scraper", "content": "As Scrape.do, we took care to explain in detail how to create a web scraper in Python with this article. We also aimed to teach you how to extract data with BeautifulSoup and save everything in a JSON and CSV file. You can take your academic career and business further with the web scraping process that helps you to automatically extract all the data you need and pre-determined from the internet. You can also use web scraping for a machine learning project, to create a price comparison, or for any other innovative idea. It is possible that you can also do web scraping manually to obtain data, but a lot of content on the internet will quickly distract you from this idea. If you don’t want to hire a web scraping service directly, you need to learn how to create a web scraper with the help of codes. As Scrape.do, we took care to explain in detail how to create a web scraper in Python with this article. We also aimed to teach you how to extract data with BeautifulSoup and save everything in a JSON and CSV file. It would still make the most sense to use a web scraping service rather than create a web scraper, so get in touch with us! What You Need to Create a Web Scraper If you want to create a web scraper, first you need to make sure that Python is installed on your computer. Although Python 3 is automatically installed in all Ubuntu 20.04 and Linux versions, this is not the case in Windows and macOS operating systems. If you want to find out if you have python on your computer, you will get an output like “Python 3.8.2” when you enter the “python3 –v” command in the script. In order to use your web scraper more conveniently and to be able to select certain data, you need to install BeautifulSoup, simply write the code “pip3 install beautifulsoup4”. You should also use Selenium to get dynamically loaded content and write the code “pip3 install selenium” to install this package. As the last step, you need to make sure you have Google Chrome and Chrome Driver on your computer, if you want to use Selenium to scrape data from dynamically loaded content, you will need Google Chrome and Chrome driver. How Do You Insert Pages Of The Website After Choosing The Website You Want? If you have everything necessary to create a web scraper installed on your computer, you need to choose a website that suits your needs. You should know that you should start using everything you learn by keeping in mind that each website structures its content differently. The code of each website has minor changes. Since we’re here today to teach you how to do web scraping, we’ve chosen the top ten movies from IMDb’s top 250 movies list as example data. We will first get the titles from this website and then extract the data from each movie’s page, we will also need to use JavaScript to access some of the data. First, you must right-click on the first title in the list and select “Inspect Element” to understand the structure of the content. You will see exactly something like this: e6DE3zczzQa-VSBIynK-fR4oyAjVbpx2PztpEDKbi3K0NII9_lFkFhGQmiOjc_-Y_Kg26cM3pecnSKNiPlLZGpntqVKUrcX9E4gDWaTsolWoCFzEGruzUvrEEhl3 Then you have to press CTRL and F keys at the same time and search the HTML code structure, find the  tag on the page because this part tells you how to access the data. To get all the titles on the page, we need an HTML selector table tbody tr td.titleColumn a. By using this CSS selector and using the inset of each anchor you will be able to access the titles you want. To simulate these headers you should write the following code: document.querySelectorAll(“table tbody tr td.titleColumn a”)[0].innerText After typing in your code, you will encounter a string of letters like “T1pgLUXJHX_s3gubDKvBjwkWeK1neZxiysoneD2Q1NU3Sj_pD8defdKorTlcsiiqShlmPDEeCu3Goo5T9CgzPKCml9dq_kCCu7KUyTx7uQr6J8Zn-a string of letters and a series of numeralsNNx7KUyTx7uSr6JBmn-N. Once you have this part, called the selector, you can start writing your Python code. Using BeautifulSoup to Extract Statically Loaded Content The top ten movie content in IMDb’s top 250 movies list, as we have determined for you, is static content. In order to understand whether the content is static or not, you must press the CTRL and U keys simultaneously on the page and select View Page Source. When you look here, you will see that all the titles are already included in the codes. You don’t need to build JavaScript to scrape static content, and scraping static content is super easy. You should use BeautifulSoup to scrape the top ten titles in this list, just write this code:‍ Using this code we have given you, you can extract the movie titles from the top ten movies list in IMDb’s top 250 movies list, for this, this code will use the selector you obtained in the first step. This code will then loop continuously through the movies in the list and display the inset of each. You are on the right track if you have output similar to this: RrmEldjCrbz7V1-o4r6UsKNuWkj_yD2cWwfyuMMbdnRn7l-sEU2n5 Scraping Dynamically Loaded Content with Selenium As technology progresses, the content on websites is no longer loaded statically, but dynamically. With dynamic loading of content, page performance has increased, user experience has been improved and an additional barrier for scrapers has emerged. Since these sites do not contain HTML dynamic content that can be retrieved with a simple request, scraping the content on these sites is much more difficult than you might think. However, using Selenium, you can simulate content in the browser and scrape data from dynamic content with ease. If you want to scrape dynamic content using Selenium, you must first know the location of the Chrome driver. The code we have given you below is actually the same code that we scrape static content using BeautifulSoup, but this time you should use Selenium for the request. You should parse the content of the page again using BeautifulSoup as you did before: Scraping Statically Uploaded Content Using the code we provided above for dynamic content, you can call the click method on each link and access any movie page you want using the code we have given below: While it’s fine to use this code that simulates a click on the first movie link, we strongly recommend that you continue to use driver.get instead. If you use driver.get, you will not need to use the click() method to access the other nine movies on the new page and you will be able to do your job more easily. You will lose performance and time by returning to the first page of the listing immediately after accessing the content in the first title in the list, as you will have to click on the content in the second title again this time. Instead of this performance and time-consuming process, it would be more logical to only use the extracted links. You need to use https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/ as the page link for “The Shawshank Redemption”, a movie that is in the top ten movies list of IMDb’s top 250 movies list. From this page, you should research what year the movie was shot and how long it took. Although you can use both BeautifulSoup and Selenium for this, this time we will prefer Selenium as an example. In order to find out in which year the movie was shot and how long it took, you need to repeat the first step on the page of the movie you selected. To access this information, use the following code: for anchor in first10: Extracting Dynamically Loaded Content by Using Selenium We can say extracting dynamically loaded content is the next step in web scraping. It is possible to find such static content in the Editorial Lists section of the page of a movie you want. If you examine the page you can find the section here as data-testid and an item with the attribute set to firstListCardGroup-editorial. However, if you look directly at the source of the page, you will not be able to find the attribute firstListCardGroup-editorial anywhere you need it. The reason for this is that the Editorial Lists section prefers to load IMBD dynamically. It is possible to scrape the editorial list of each movie with the sample code we have provided below.‍ How Do You Save Your Obtained Data as CSV and JSON? Now that you have all the data you want, you should save it in JSON or CSV files for easier reading. To do this, you need to write your content to new files by using the JSON and CSV packages in Python. All you have to do is use the code we have given below: ‍ 3 Tips for Web Scraping to Make Your Job Easier Since almost everything we’ve covered so far is for JavaScript rendering scenarios, we’ll talk a little bit about Selenium in this section. Let’s take a look at three different web scraping tricks that can come in handy and make your job really easy. 1. Put Your Requests In Timeout Breaks If you send spam consisting of hundreds of different requests to a server in a short time, you may encounter a captcha code at this point and cause your IP address to be blocked. You have to make a permanent code change because you have no option to avoid it for a short time while using Python. You should try to put some timeout intervals between your requests in order to make your traffic to the website look more natural. For this, you will need to use the following code: 2. Add Bugs to Your Code Since most the websites are dynamic and can change their structure at any time, if you plan to use the same web scraper all the time, you should make use of the bug reporting system. This error injection system can have trial and error syntax. This bug insertion will come in handy when you’re waiting for an item to load, removing it, and requesting it, and your action will look very natural. 3. Add Screenshot Code If you want to take a screenshot of the web page you want to scrape at any time, you can use the codes below. These codes will also prevent debugging of dynamically loaded content."},

Scrape.do’s web scraping service lets you collect data from any website, including product listings, news articles, real estate listings, and reviews. Launched a little over fifteen years ago and getting better every day since then, Google Maps not only tells you how to get from point A to point B, but it also has many uses. The most common uses of Google Maps are real-time traffic maps and route planning with cars, in addition to visual content such as satellite images and aerial photos, and you can also map to bicycle, public transport, and pedestrian information thanks to Google Maps. In addition to these, we can say that Google Maps is frequently used to find local businesses and to get more information, especially the scores and prices of local businesses. Scraping Google Maps helps businesses collect and review data from other local businesses. Imagine that you have moved to a new place and you need to have your hair done, for which you need to find a good hairdresser. The first thing you would do would be to type the keyword “hairdresser” into Google Maps, and then find the business that fits your budget and has the best reviews and reviews at the same time, right? Using the same Google Maps, it is possible to find out when a store, shop, or service can be open. Thanks to the update feature of Google Maps, it becomes possible to learn when opening and closing times change. All this data and valuable customer reviews will be of great help to your business if you combine them properly and store them in a usable format. You can automate and make it easy to get all the data in Google Maps by starting Google Maps scraping. Scrape.do is a web scraping service that simplifies the process of extracting data from any website. Scrape.do’s web scraping tool makes it easy to collect data quickly and easily, whether you’re integrating data into a CRM, building a website, or collecting pricing information. Scrape.do’s web scraping service lets you collect data from any website, including product listings, news articles, real estate listings, and reviews. What is Google Maps? Google Maps is one of the best data listing sources you can get, allowing you to get job opportunities as well as review other businesses. All people looking for a shop, service, or similar place to go to for any purpose examine the data of businesses registered on Google Maps. The data people review includes things like the business name, location, customer reviews and reviews, and prices. In addition, if people want to visit a business, they get the contact data of those businesses from here. According to recent research, more than two-fifths of people using the internet use Google Maps for global purposes and use the data there. Google Maps has managed to attract about 30 percent of Google searches and has been able to serve billions of users both locally and geographically. It is also known that Google Maps has a market share of 67% worldwide and is the most widely used navigation application in the world. Considering that Google Maps consists of more than twenty petabytes of data in total, and most of this data consists of millions of small cities in towns and cities, Google Maps is one of the best places to choose for local searches. Almost thirteen percent of searches from Google are about maps, so it’s certainly not surprising that Google Maps has become such a large and constantly growing dataset. When it comes to this dataset and user base that Google Maps has, we can also understand why Google Maps has taken over 67% of the navigation application market. What Data You Can Get By Scraping Google Maps: The Complete List! If you want to scrape Google Maps, you may need to consider the data that can be extracted, thanks to this data you can make an extremely effective arrangement. Google Maps, which can be useful for almost any organization, has the information and data that almost any business may need. Whether you’re a laundry service such as a laundromat or looking for a cake shop, the data you can get by scraping Google Maps will be: Business name Business ratings Number of reviews of the business The price range of the business Type of establishment of the business About the business The full address of the business Operation hours of the business Phone number of the business If the business has a website, the address of the business website The most frequent visit times to the business during the day Photos of the business Customer reviews about the business A business can add all the items we have listed above, or this data may emerge as a result of people updating this data. It is possible that most of the data types we mentioned above are missing if no one has made any updates. Google Maps has a program called Local Guides, which it uses to enable users to take pictures of the places they go and update the information of the places they visit frequently, thanks to this program, the data set in Google Maps is updated in real-time so that businesses that want to access the data and It also becomes possible for real people to access data. Even newly opened businesses are frequently listed on Google Maps, especially with new data types added to organizations already on Google Maps, making it possible for everyone to know about a business. It is possible and very easy to get business listings and other posts about businesses if you want by scraping Google Maps. Although some information will change from time to time due to reasons such as seasonal changes and natural disasters, businesses, and customers visiting businesses update this business information so that people always have access to accurate information. For example, during COVID, many businesses have become takeaways, so the timings of businesses have been changed or other rules have been introduced to businesses. As a result of many businesses updating this information, people got accurate information about businesses. What Can You Do Using Local Business Data in Google Maps? If you manage to use local business data in Google Maps properly and correctly, this data can become extremely valuable to your business and you can get answers to questions that can only be solved with data. Using local business data from Google Maps, you can do things like market research, data collection, sentiment analysis and protecting brand image, competitive analysis. 1. Market Research Using local business data, it is possible for companies and businesses to conduct market research and find solutions to many problems. For example, if you want to open a shop by making an agreement with a fast-food company, you can find out how many fast-food restaurants are in which part of the city by logging into Google Maps, and in this way, you can choose the right region and set a great location for your business. It is also possible to use this information to understand which areas are densely populated by fast food-loving people. In addition to all of these, it is also possible for you to open a restaurant in whichever region has fewer fast-food restaurants, and to have a higher chance of becoming the best fast-food restaurant in your region. Data sets, such as people’s ratings, can be used by businesses to understand what types of crowds of people in a location are, how they pay in general, what they don’t like and like, and what they want. It’s always best to use local business data from Google Maps, as you can even indirectly use data from local businesses that aren’t relevant to your business. For example, if you want to open a tour and travel company, but you are not sure what you want in your business, for this, you can review the reviews of other tour and travel companies. 2. Data Collection When you collect any data format, you have the chance to bring these data groups together, and when you look at these data as a whole, you have a broad picture and perspective on the situation, this also applies to business data. It collects data only for certain types of businesses, helping you solve key issues, missed and unnoticed spots, new business entry coverage, and more. By using the data you can collect from different businesses on Google Maps, you can easily open doors that only one business’s data cannot open for you, and you can have plenty of information in every field. For example, you have decided to start a hyper-local delivery service and you will start collaborating with the most popular stores and service providers in your area to start this business. For this, you will need to review businesses in advance. You can use data from Google Maps to rank these businesses based on their ratings and customer reviews. Using this data, you can make your choices more accurately and list the businesses you have chosen in order of importance. 3. Sentiment Analysis and Protecting Brand Image Since the perception of a business today is as important as the products it sells or the services it offers, businesses should also attach great importance to protecting their brand image. If you want to know what kind of brand image any business has, it will be enough to review the latest reviews on different platforms, this data will provide you with valuable information about the brand image of the business you want. Thanks to the local business data in Google Maps, it is possible to access thousands of reviews of millions of businesses and have information about the brand image of these businesses. You can also access great data through these reviews and reviews. With the data you have obtained, you can both perform sentiment analysis and easily learn what businesses do right and what they do wrong. Scraping Google Maps is the fastest and easiest way to get all the local business data you need. Although you can analyze specific customer reviews one by one, you will not be able to manually review thousands of reviews. By getting a web scraping software for this, you can sort the customer reviews of this software according to whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. In this way, it will be possible to use the data you obtain from Google Maps again and again. 4. Competitive Analysis By gaining insight into competing businesses, you can put your business in a better position, and getting the right competitive analysis is just as important as offering great products and services. That’s why almost all companies want to collect data from similar businesses on a regular basis. It is possible to reach all the data you want to obtain via Google Maps. You will also be able to use all this data for purposes such as creating pricing strategies, planning opening and closing timings, providing additional services, and examining customer perception. By using all this information, you can both improve and make data-based business decisions easily. How to Get Google Maps Data: Top 2 Ways Although there are many ways to get information and data about local businesses through Google Maps, we have listed the two most popular ways, thinking that you will want to get this data quickly. We can describe and list these two ways as follows: Writing Your Own Code: If you actually want to use code to scrape a website like Google Maps and you’re going to write that code yourself, this process can be very difficult for you. This is because the user interface of Google Maps is updated frequently and listings of different types of businesses are listed in different formats, often containing different data and attributes. Also, if you log into more than one map page from the same IP address in a very short time, your IP address may be blacklisted. It is extremely difficult and expensive to build a customized web scraping solution to read information from local businesses located in different locations and update this information in real-time. It will also bring with it the overhead of infrastructure installation and maintenance after creating this software. Paid or Free Software Solutions: People who want to take advantage of this solution method are usually a business team with little coding knowledge, this business team needs web scraping services. Software companies that see these requirements, on the other hand, provide web scraping services, meeting the requirements of the companies.

Choose the right web scraping language and how to do error-free and risk-free web scraping.", "h1": "Top 4 Programming Languages for Web Scraping", "content": "In this article, we told you why you should choose the right language, whether web scraping speed depends on the software language, how to do error-free and risk-free web scraping, and the best programming languages​​for web scraping. Which programming language should I choose for web scraping? Just like any other technology today, web scraping is constantly advancing and expanding, evolving and changing every day. Although web scraping was an extremely simple process written in simple code in the past, today it has become an extremely complex process where many different software tools are used and executed in line with these software tools. More importantly, web scraping can be built with various programming languages ​​and can also be performed with a number of proxies. You cannot do web scraping without using a programming language, as web scraping would be an impossible process without scraping bots. Bots are extremely important to web scraping tools that you need to code properly to perform certain actions. These web scraping tools may be powered by artificial intelligence, or they may be software-only. If you want to develop viable data scraping tools, you need to learn the basics of programming. In this article, we told you why you should choose the right language, whether web scraping speed depends on the software language, how to do error-free and risk-free web scraping, and the best programming languages​​for web scraping. If you don’t want to learn a brand new programming language from scratch, or if you want to run a web scraping project without the need for software, Scrape.do team would like to help you. Simply contact us to take advantage of our cloud-based web scraping tools. Choose us to get the best service at the cheapest prices in the industry! Why is Choosing the Right Language for Web Scraping Important? Learning a good programming language is essential if you want to build a scraping bot and scan the web. After learning the programming language, you can create a web scraper bot that can target websites, filter relevant content to get the data you need, and easily scrape the web. If you want your web scraping project, whether large or small, to be successful, you need to choose the right programming language for this task. The language you choose to create a web scraper bot is extremely important because the more complex code the bot you create, the easier it can perform web scraping and help you get the data you want. If you want to choose one of the best scripting languages ​​for your web scraping, you should make sure that your scripting language has these features: Level of flexibility to edit as you wish Operational ability to develop and nurture your database Possibility of high-level scanning and scraping Easy to code Being scalable Being sustainable Ability to avoid mechanisms such as blocking and detection that can negatively affect your web scraping process Does Your Web Scraping Project Completion Speed ​​Depend On The Programming Language You Choose? While many beginners think that the programming language affects the completion speed of their web scraping projects a lot, in fact, the processing speed of the programming language is a factor that does not affect the web scraping speed too much. When we think practically, we can say that the main factor that affects the speed the most is the input/output. If you want your web scraping speed to increase, the main point you should pay attention to is communication with the internet. As it is known, the speed of your internet cannot easily keep up with the speed of your processor. However, this does not mean that the speed of the coding languages ​​and themselves are unimportant. The speed of a programming language often depends on the speed of development, ease of maintenance, and code readability. Naturally, the speed of completion of your web scraping project also depends on the potential speed of your programming language. How to Execute a Web Project That Doesn’t Contain Risk and Errors in Any Way? Proxy servers, which will come across as one of the best solutions you can use if you want to run a secure and efficient web scraping project, have the middle stage role between a user and the website that the user wants to access. Let’s reinforce it with an example. If you want to access information from a website and scrape that information and store it elsewhere, you must first send a request to the website owner asking for access. However, this request will reach the proxy server just before it reaches the owner of the website you want to scrape. After the proxy server sees your request, it will change the IP address and send your request to access the website to the website owner. Since your proxy server shows the website owner by changing your IP address, you will not be at any risk and you will be able to start viewing the data and scraping the data you want after your request is automatically approved by the website owner. We mentioned that the proxy server changes your IP address, so it will be impossible to track your trace on the internet. Since web scraping will not be a one-time process and you will be doing web scraping frequently, you will need to make some changes and take advantage of programs to understand what requirements you will need and to ensure that your web scraping projects are not hindered. Best Programming Languages ​​for Web Scraping: Top 4 Let’s list the top five programming languages​​you can use for web scraping, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and C++. You should continue reading this section to learn the language that you can use for your web scraping project and which is most suitable for you. After reading this chapter, you will understand more clearly which programming language you need. 1. JavaScript According to statistics published by Github, a famous code-sharing site, JavaScript, which was chosen as the most popular programming language last year, was originally designed for front-end web development. Thanks to this coding language, which has the Node.js environment, it has become possible to develop web applications. As an important part of Javascript, Node.js also has libraries such as Puppeteer and Axios that are often used for web scraping. Puppeteer was chosen as the best library according to a 2019 study comparing which libraries are better for web scraping projects, and it performed much more efficiently than the other options. If you have even some experience with JavaScript, you should use JavaScript with Node.js. Here are the benefits of using JavaScript for web scraping: JavaScript is one of the best programming languages ​​to find support through large communities, online forums, and tutorials. Compared to other programming languages ​​in this article, we can say that JavaScript is the programming language that has the most questions and therefore resources on Stackoverflow. You can process simultaneous web page queries using Node.js at the same time and get a very efficient result as a result of this process. For operations that require a constant stream of data input and data output, Node.js has much better performance than Python. Also, if you use Node.js, your waiting time will be minimized. Here are the challenges you will encounter when using JavaScript for web scraping: JavaScript is not easy for people with no knowledge of coding or programming to understand. JavaScript is not as good, robust, and efficient as Python for CPU-intensive tasks like parsing and editing data after collecting large amounts of data. There is also a challenge known as callback hell for JavaScript, which is of a nature that allows multiple queries to run efficiently. This challenge addresses a nested function structure that cascades a bug in any function to other layers of the code. Developers with no experience in JavaScript should be aware of workarounds to avoid this hassle. 2. Python Python, the second most common programming language of 2021, is extremely convenient and easy to understand, especially for programmers who are just starting out with the coding. To automate the web scraping task, Python includes Selenium as well as third-party libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy specifically for web scraping. Python is often used for web scraping because Python is extremely easy to use and has a wealth of open-source guides and tutorials. If you are new to coding and web scraping, it would make the most sense to continue any web scraping project you have with Python. Here are the benefits of Python: While JavaScript is the most popular when it comes to the availability of online resources and community, Python is also extremely rich in resources. Python is the ideal language for people with little or no experience because Python is easier to understand than other languages. Here are some of the challenges you may encounter once you start using Python: Python’s most popular challenges are language-specific rather than web scraping-specific. One of these problems is that database access is weaker. Python has weaker protocols for database access compared to JDBC or ODBC, so Python is less preferred by companies because of its database. If you want your web scraping results to be stored directly in your database, you should integrate another layer for that. Python is one of the slowest languages ​​compared to other programming languages. According to tests on Benchmarksgame, Python is extremely slow compared to JavaScript. However, when it comes to web scraping, the speed of the programming language largely depends on the code of the program and the quality and quantity of requests made to the website. For this reason, whether you use Python or JavaScript, your web scraping project can be extremely long to complete. 3. Ruby When we compare Ruby with Python and JavaScript, we can say that Ruby is much less used by programmers, but this programming language has certain features tailored to web scraping use cases. For example, Ruby’s library called Nokogiri has powerful ways to parse HTML and XML that you can use to output web scraping. Here’s why you should use Ruby: Although Ruby’s syntax is not as interpretable as Python’s, coding with Python’s functionality can be done in Ruby with fewer lines of code. Ruby’s Bundler feature makes it easy to manage and distribute packages from GitHub, helping you save time, especially on projects where you need to use an existing package. Ruby’s Nokogiri library will be able to deal with broken HTML code more easily than other languages. If you’re wondering why Ruby isn’t so popular, you should definitely check out these challenges: Ruby is not a programming language of choice as much as Python and Javascript because it has far fewer resources and community tools. Machine learning and NLP toolkits are some of the most important use cases that rely on web scraping data and are often the purpose of web scraping. These toolkits were not developed for Ruby, just as they were not developed for other languages ​​such as Python. If you choose Ruby for data collection and parsing, models may still need to be developed in other languages. 4. C++ While running a web scraping project with C and C++, which offers outstanding execution, is extremely costly, these languages ​​are often preferred for web scraping. It is not recommended to use this language for just web scraping unless you want to have a dedicated organization for web scraping and data storage only. Let’s explain why you should choose C++ for web scraping, listing it as follows: The C++ scripting language is extremely easy to use and customize for web scraping. Just use C++’s libcurl to get the URL addresses. You don’t need a library to turn the entire HTML document into a scannable structure, as scraping just for a specific topic is simpler than editing and executing a DOM tree. The most important advantage of using the C++ scripting language is that you can easily parallelize your scraper. Here is a list of reasons why it is not appropriate to use C++ for web scraping: For any web scraping-related project, using C++ will definitely not be a great choice, as it will be easier to handle using a dynamic language. As we explained earlier, if you want to set up a web scraping setup using C++, you may have to pay quite a bit of money. If you want to learn a programming language for your web scraping projects and save time and hassle for data extraction and parsing, you can get help from a web scraping agency. We at Scrape.do offer you cloud services that speed up the process and facilitate data storage and enable you to enjoy all the benefits of cloud web scraping. You also need additional development when you use the web scraping program yourself.

With web scraping, which is both a manual and automatic method that you can use to extract large amounts of data from websites, you can obtain data that you can later use for various purposes. Much of this data is unstructured data in HTML format that will later be transformed into structured data in a spreadsheet or database for use in various applications. If you want to perform web scraping to extract data from websites, you should know that there is more than one of these ways. If we talk about these ways briefly, we can say that online services, API usage, or even your own web scraping code that you created from scratch. You can access the data of many large websites such as Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, and Instagram in a structured way because these websites have APIs that allow you to do this. While this would be one of the best options, there are also websites that do not allow users to access large amounts of data in a structured form. In addition, since some websites are not that technologically advanced, you may not be able to obtain their data in a structured way. In this case, it would be most logical to use the web scraping method to get data from websites. If you want to do web scraping, you first need to know that two parts are required, the scanner and the scraper. The browser that monitors the links on the internet can be defined as an artificial intelligence algorithm that searches for the data you need by surfing the internet. Scrapers, on the other hand, are special codes created to extract data from a website. The design of the scraper you use for web scraping cannot be the same for every website. If you want to get data quickly and extremely accurately, you should know that you need to change your web scraper according to the complexity and scope of your project. Learn More Learn the ways that make you learn web scraping. If someone wants to learn web scraping well, they must first identify the right resources from which they can learn data science in an easy way. In this article, we've covered the methods and … ‍ Working Principle of Web Scrapers In order to get the most out of web scrapers that allow you to extract all data from certain websites or only certain data that the user specifically requests and get results quickly, you need to pass the data you want to your web scraper. For example, you want to collect data from local e-commerce sites for blender types with an icebreaker feature. You can access not only customer reviews but also data on different models of juicers if you do the necessary coding and adjustment. If you want a web scraper to scrape a website, first a list of URL addresses to be scraped needs to be made and passed to this web scraper. Immediately after, your web scraper will load all the HTML codes for these websites. If you have a more advanced scraper, it will be possible to extract not only HTML codes, but also all CSS and JavaScript elements. After the HTML code is scraped, your web scraper will take the necessary data from the HTML code and extract and store this data in the format the user wants. While the files you want are usually in the form of an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file, the data you obtain can be saved in other formats, such as a JSON file, if you specifically request it. 3 Types of Web Scrapers With different web scraping tools and services involved, distinguishing these services and deciding which service is better than the other can be more difficult than you think. We have prepared for you in this section classification of all the web scraping tools available in the market based on how they work and where they are stored. 1. Browser Extension If you’re aiming to scrape small bits of data from specific web pages, you can get help from web scrapers in the form of browser extensions. If you don’t want to install separate software on your computer and want to browse and scrape data with a small browser plugin, this is the best web scraping tool you can choose. You can easily install this web scraping tool and scrape data from any website you want with ease. In addition, your data will be downloadable in CSV or any other format. While a web scraper in the form of a browser extension is extremely easy to obtain and use, these web scrapers have one major limitation. Web scrapers with browser extensions are designed to only scrape one page at a time, so you shouldn’t choose them if you are looking for a tool to extract large amounts of data. However, if you only want to scrape a small part of a website, using a web scraper in the form of a browser extension will make your job easier. 2. Software As the amount and variety of data have grown, multiple companies have produced downloadable software that can scrape any type of data. Just as you need to install any software on your computer, you may also need to install web scraping software on your computer. In this case, you also need to find out if the software is related to your computer, but if you are using a Windows-based computer, there is no need to worry, all you have to do is configure the software to be used. If you have configured the software you have installed to be used, you are ready to scrape data from any websites you want with your web scraper. If you are wondering how to save the data you will get, we can say that you can save your data in CSV or any downloadable format you want. If you want to get small or medium-sized pieces of data, using web scraper software will make the most sense for you. A web scraper in the form of a browser extension scrapes one page at a time, while with a software web scraper it is possible to scrape one or more pages. 3. Cloud Based Compared to other web scrapers in the form of browser extensions or software, cloud-based web scraping is the most robust solution. You don’t have to install cloud-based web scrapers on your computer and you don’t have to use your internet for it. All you have to do is to configure your plan and requirement, right after that, you can get as much data as you want and in the field, you want via API and downloadable format and save it to your computer or database. If you need to scrape large amounts of data and you are worried about the problems you may encounter while scraping that data, taking advantage of a cloud-based web scraping service is the best move you can make for yourself. The most important reason why there is no upper limit on the amount of data to be extracted is that cloud-based web scraping services are designed to work in multiple information environments. While in other web scraping services and web scraping tools you have to manually press the start and stop keys, in the cloud-based web scraping service you can get rid of all this and complete the web scraping without any problems.

While web … ‍ Web Scraping Applications Now that we’ve talked about the types of web scraping tools and what web scraping is in detail, it’s time to talk about what web scraping tools and web scraping are used for. Web scraping is extremely important because using web scraping tools you can gain insights that can provide actionable insights in areas such as machine learning training, price intelligence, brand protection, lead generation, consumer sentiment monitoring, SEO auditing, and keyword research. Let’s take a look at these areas one by one: Machine learning training: A huge amount of data is needed to improve the accuracy of the outputs of artificial intelligence and algorithms because machine learning algorithms can be improved in line with the data. If you try to manually collect large amounts of accurate training data, you will have to struggle. With the web scraping method that data scientists use to improve machine learning models, you can easily get the training dataset you need. Price intelligence: If you have an e-commerce site or store and you want to increase your income by selling your products at the most affordable prices, you should use the price intelligence method. It is possible to use the web scraping method, which you can use to obtain the most accurate information while determining dynamic prices. Brand protection: By using web scraping, you can detect all online content that may harm your brand, and as a result of this detection, you can protect your brand value by starting legal content about some online content. For example, you should identify companies that design fake products using your brand name and definitely prevent people from buying products from these sellers. Fake stores may reduce your income and create a false impression of the quality of your products. Another prefix is ​​the unauthorized use of copyrighted and published content in a way that causes copyright infringement. You can also check for copyright infringement using web scrapers. When it comes to copyright infringement, you should remember that it’s not just content, it can be patent theft and illegal use of a logotype, pattern, wording, or another brand-related element. Lead generation : Each store needs to acquire additional customers to thrive and earn more, and web scraping helps businesses in their lead generation efforts.

This web scraping bot was called World Wide Web Wanderer, and its main purpose was to measure the size of the World Wide Web. The first e-commerce web scraping site was potentially malicious and was called Bidder’s Edge. Introduced in the early 2000s, the main purpose of this malicious bot was to collect competing prices among auction sites. A lawsuit was filed by eBay and Bidder’s Edge which was in the early 2000s but the court saw no problem with the web scraping action. However, the overload on eBay servers resulted in lost revenue because the scraping bots were pulling in too much data. Even today, web scraping is still in a legal gray area, so waiting for a legal solution to this problem will leave your website unattended and unprotected. So instead, online businesses need to implement efficient technical bot protection and scraper bot detection measures. Who Uses Web Scraper Bots and Why? You can consider your content as gold, the main purpose of each visitor to your website is to see that gold. While visitors to your website examine your gold like an exhibition, threat actor bots want to get your gold. Web scrapers are used to collect and use this content on your website. There can be many reasons for this, but the common reason is to republish your content or automatically lower your prices and the value of your website.

If you want to develop a defense against an attack against you, you must first understand what your enemy is like and know your enemy. Let’s take a look at these stages in order: First, the target URL address and parameter values ​​are determined and the attack is started. At this stage, web scrapers create user accounts that look real but are completely fake, and these actually malicious scraper bots start surfing your website’s servers, pretending to be good. These bots, which hide their source IP addresses and can do more for privacy, also make some preparations to launch a web scraping attack.

The best … ‍ How To Protect From Web Scraping: Protect Your Website Against Scrapers in 3 Steps! If you want to protect your website against web scrapers, there are many methods you can try, but in this section, we will provide information on how to secure your website, stop unusual traffic on your website, and protect the content on your website. How to Secure Your Website Against Web Scrapers? If you want to protect your website against web scrapers, you should edit the terms and conditions of use and use cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. You should arrange the Terms of Use and Conditions of your website If you want to prevent your content and website from being scraped, one of the simplest and most effective ways you can do is to write on your Terms of Use page that your website data cannot be scraped and that you absolutely do not allow content scraping. While expressing this, you must state that the content on your website may only be used or reproduced for personal and non-commercial use. The malicious hackers won’t stop when you do this, but the honest ones will, and you’ll also gain a legal advantage when you detect web scraping. You should use cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens Cross-site request forgery tokens that you can apply to your website are software created by an internet server that transmits a number to the client when the client makes an HTTP request. If the client makes another request, your web server will check for CSRF tokens in this request, and if the token is missing, your web server will prevent this request from happening. If you apply CSRF tokens to a website and start using them, it will prevent automation bots and other automation software from making random requests to your website URL addresses. However, even though you are using CSRF tokens, you should keep in mind that a web scraper bot can be complex enough to look for the right token. How to Monitor Your Traffic and Limit Unusual Activity on Your Website? If you want to prevent web scrapers from scraping your website, you need to set up a monitoring system, when this monitoring system detects the existence of web scraper bots, their activity will be blocked or limited. You should limit requests on your website As you can see from the title of this section, you can set a limit so that web scrapers as well as legitimate users can only take a certain number of actions in a given time period. To explain in more detail, you can set the actions from a specific user or IP address to be every minute or every second, and you can also allow them to make a certain number of calls. If this would significantly slow down the activities of the web scraper bots, you would limit and block traffic. If you don’t want this to happen, you’ll have to go beyond IP address detection. However, let’s share with you the indicators that can help you detect scraper bots and list them as follows: Linear mouse movements Extremely fast form submissions Checking browser types Checking the screen resolution Checking the time zone If an internet connection is shared with many people, everyone in the household to which that internet is connected will have the same IP address and all requests will be from legitimate users. You should try to differentiate between real human users and web scraper bots by looking at other factors, not just IP addresses. You must use a website that will require an account creation If you are sure that the data on your website is scraped a lot and extremely quickly, you can ask users to register and log in before accessing your content. While it is a good precaution for web scrapers that users have to constantly login, this will affect the user experience and cause legitimate users to stay away from your website. So you may need to use this method sparingly. Also with some complex code, web scrapers also have features like signing up for websites, these web scrapers can automatically log in to their account and still scrape your data, it is also possible for these web scrapers to create multiple accounts. The best move you can do at this point is to request an e-mail address for the registration of users and not to give access to the website before this e-mail address is verified. You should get help from the CAPTCHAs CAPTCHAs, whose long name is Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, are software that will help you understand whether a request comes from a human or a bot. It is possible to take action against web scrapers and automated scripts by using this software. The general purpose of a CAPTCHA test is to prepare a test that human users can easily solve, while some bots will definitely not be able to solve these CAPTCHA tests. You can include CAPTCHA on special pages where you do not want your data to be taken, or you can have CAPTCHA activated in case your system detects a possible scraper. Let’s also mention that there are various ways web scrapers can get rid of CAPTCHAs. How to Secure Your Pages on Your Website? Although we have mentioned that you can use logins, CAPTCHAs, and request limiting to prevent your content from being scraped, none of these will 100% prevent your content from being stolen. That’s why you should regularly change your HTML and create honey pot pages to better prevent the scraping of content on your website. After doing all these, your website content will be extremely protected. You should change your HTML regularly Finding patterns and possible vulnerabilities in a website’s HTML code, a method generally preferred and tried by web scrapers, will be a real problem for you unless you change your website’s codes. Because if perpetrators detect these vulnerabilities, they can perform more attacks on your website’s HTML address. If you don’t want your website to be attacked because of your HTML codes, you should change your website’s HTML markup frequently and make a browser think that the HTML codes on your website are uniform or inconsistent. If you do this, attackers who cannot detect your site’s HTML patterns will be discouraged. In addition, these changes that you will make on your website do not necessarily mean that you should redesign your website. However, it’s still in your best interest to regularly change the ID and class in your HTML and CSS files. You should create a honey pot or trap pages Honey pot pages, which are hidden pages that a website visitor cannot click, can also be hidden elements on a website. Web scrapers have to click on any link on a predetermined website, so they are trapped by clicking on that website link. For example, you can make edits to blend in with the background of a web page and hide the link completely. If any visitor logs into this link, you can be sure that this person is not a real person.

As with any application, the core of this application is data, and you use data from a small number of websites to develop your application. Once your app is hit and trending, you need to start data extraction using web scraping, which requires a massive scale of up to 500 websites. If you want to do web scraping on a large scale, you need to make sure that the tool you use for web scraping is more secure. If you want to do web scraping on a large scale, but you are sure that you will face many difficulties while doing it, it will make the most sense to seek the help of an expert.

If You Want to Do Web Scraping On A Large Scale Take These 7 Steps: You Can’t Be Stopped Anymore! If you want to do a large-scale web scraping, first keep in mind that you cannot do this large-scale scraping manually, store or process it. You will need a solid environment to use web scraping where you can run your scrapers on multiple websites at the same time and extract data. If you want to do your large-scale web scraping without being stopped, without fear, you should follow the steps we have listed for you. To briefly mention these steps, we can say that creating a scanning path, using proxy services, using a database, data parsing, detecting and blocking anti-bot systems, using CAPTCHA solver services, and performing regular maintenance. Let’s take a closer look at these steps: 1. Creating a Scan Path Creating a crawl path, the most important part of large-scale web scraping is a step that should never be skipped. By using web browsing services, you can find the features that distinguish your business from other businesses and put them ahead of them, as well as discover the good and bad sides of your competitors. When you create the crawl path, which can also be called a URL library from which all data is extracted, you will have some URLs that are important to your business and need to be scrapped. 2. Using Proxy Services If you want to scan content on a large scale, the most important thing you should do is to take advantage of Proxy IP services. When you use these services, your proxy IPs will be blocked, and you can apply IP rotation for this. You should note that the Proxy services you will prefer are among the Proxy services that can request restrictions and manage your sessions. Almost all companies that offer web scraping services give utmost importance to Proxy management to eliminate any confusion that may arise in Proxy management. When you get help from a company that provides a proxy service, you can give importance to content analysis, not proxy services. You can also get great results if you can use a good proxy in addition to the right strategy and web scraping knowledge. 3. Creating a Database If you want to do a large-scale web scraping, you should be ready to create a database to store your verified data somewhere. When you parse small volumes, a single spreadsheet will do, and you don’t need a large database. However, if you are planning to do a large-scale web scraping, you need to use a powerful and large database. You can create a database using storage options such as MySQL, cloud storage, and MongoDB, which you can adjust according to your frequency and parsing speed. You also need a robust database for the security of the data you obtain, so you must be prepared to spend time and money on maintenance. 4. Parsing Data A data parser is used in data parsing, which is a process for transforming data into an actively usable and more understandable form. Although it may seem easy to create a data parser, you must be prepared to deal with several challenges to protect your data parser. You will struggle to adapt to different page formats, and your development team will have to constantly struggle with this. While web scraping was more difficult, which previously required labor, resources, and time, it is now possible to perform large-scale data collection using technology and automation. 5. Detecting and Blocking Anti-Bot Systems Just as you have to put more effort into scraping data from complex websites, scraping a defensive website will be extremely difficult. Today’s major websites use anti-bot measures to isolate bots from visitors and track bots to protect them from being scraped. Due to such anti-bot measures, the performance of the browsers you use will decrease and anti-bot measures will cause web scraping to be performed incorrectly. If you want to get the results you want from browsers without any problems, you need to design browsers against them and take advantage of reverse engineering practices using anti-bot measures. If some websites have noticed that you are a bot and have banned you, you should check if geo-blocking is enabled on the title or website. If you take advantage of the built-in Proxy services, you can still continue web scraping once the website’s data center disables your proxies. 6. Using CAPTCHA Resolving Services Another important thing to do is to check if you have a CAPTCHA solver service before you start web scraping. If you do not have a CAPTCHA solver service, you can reduce your chance of getting CAPTCHA by making use of Proxy types, regional proxies, and Javascript methods to avoid CAPTCHA. If you have tried everything and still get CAPTCHA, you have no choice but to use third-party CAPTCHA solver services. Feel free to use a CAPTCHA solver service. 7. Making Regular Adjustments If you are using a web scraper, you should remember that you need to periodically make adjustments to keep your web scraper active. If there is even a small change in the target websites, you should remember that you need to make a large-scale change for this. If you don’t make changes in line with changes in target websites, your scrapers will provide invalid data and will be crushed by new website changes. If you want to overcome this, you need notifications that can alert you when a problem arises. You also need a support team so that issues can be resolved through human intervention or custom code distribution. You also need a certain amount of time for the scrapers to repair themselves. If you want to scrape data on a large scale, you must find ways to reduce the request cycle time and improve the performance of browsers. In order to find these methods, you will need to improve, perhaps upgrade, your hardware and proxy management.

If you want to create a suitable web scraper for yourself, there are some points to consider. If you are going to create a web scraper, you first need to determine what type of online information you are after and from which websites you want to retrieve data. Since websites are constantly becoming more complex and this complexity changes wildly, it is not possible to find a permanent solution for quickly and seamlessly collecting data from every website. The more complex a website, the more complex your web scraper will have to deal with. That’s why you need to adapt to the tips we share with you in this section. 1. You Should Start by Choosing The Right Web Scraping Framework If you want to start building a web scraper, the first thing you need to do is choose the right framework. If you choose the right framework, your web scrapers will be long-lasting and extremely flexible. The best decision you can make in this regard would be to build your web scraper on an open-source framework. If you save your web scraper on an open source framework, you get a lot of flexibility and at the same time, you have the ability to do the highest level of customization. It is also possible that you are one of the users who has worked with this tool and adapted it in interesting ways. If you want to find an open source framework to build your web scraper, let’s share with you that the most widely used framework currently is Scrapy. However, depending on what your operating system is and what programming language you want to use, you can find other great open-source frameworks. You can perform a versatile scraping using the Python scripting language and Python is the best scripting language in this field. However, just as there are alternatives to Scrapy, there are also Python alternatives that you can prefer when the websites you will scrape have a more complex structure. One of these alternatives is Javascript. To summarize this section, if you are doing or planning to do large-scale web scraping, you will need to check beforehand where and when you will do it. If you use a closed framework, it will be extremely difficult to control your web scraping process. In addition, there is always a risk that your web scrapers will get stuck in a position that you cannot move, which should be avoided. 2. You Should Keep Your Web Scrapers Consistently Fresh If you want to put your web scrapers together, the most important thing to consider is how easy it will be if you need to replace them later. These changes will vary depending on what your goals are. Sometimes a simple change and a fundamental change may be required, but this is extremely important and your success or failure may depend entirely on that change. After all, while websites are constantly changing and they would be great for a constant flow of information, for strict logic web scrapers this can be a real nightmare. If the rules change, strict web scrapers will report inaccurate and outdated data. In some cases, even web scrapers will crash completely. You can also disappear without any information from web scraping and need to spend a lot of time figuring out what it is. If you want good results and you will need to adjust your web scrapers regularly to keep them working at their best, this should be at least once a month. 3. You Should Test Your Data Regularly You should routinely test your data to make sure you are reporting accurately. If you don’t control the quality of your data, your web scrapers can be outdated, and functionally useless for months, and you won’t notice any of it. It is extremely important to check your data regularly, even for small-scale transactions. Incredibly important even for small-scale web scraping, it’s not hard to imagine how important this process can be for large-scale operations. If you are sure that you are not getting your data properly and you want to fix it, of course, you can, there is a way to reduce the time you have to spend. But the important thing is not to fix a web scraping tool after it breaks, the important thing is that your web scraping tool should be designed in such a way that it can always get quality information. For this, you should develop some criteria that will ensure the quality of your data and set up a system to report them. 4. You Should Be Careful with Storage If you are sure that you are getting your data correctly and of high quality and you can get your data quickly, you should find a storage solution and start using it so that nothing goes to waste. If you are using a web scraper for a small-scale project, a simple spreadsheet will suffice, but if you want to run a large-scale project, the data you collect will take up more space than a spreadsheet. You should have tools sorted to properly store this data. Although databases come in many forms, you don’t need to search other databases if you are looking for the most suitable database, if you have a large amount of distributed data, a NoSQL database is the best place to choose. Need to scrape? We can do that. Scrape.do is a web scraping service that provides high-quality web scraping and data extraction from any website at affordable prices.

History of Major Web Scraping Lawsuits While running web scraping projects and scraping a website is superficially legal, scraping is not something companies want. If websites can show that scraping by a bot has damaged that website’s infrastructure and operations, it will be found illegal by the court. In this section, we have collected many cases in which many courts are in favor of scraped websites. Before examining these cases, businesses should also know that unless there is an overarching law, they cannot get results like the cases we describe below. ‍ eBay and Bidder’s Edge Litigation : In the eBay and Bidder’s Edge lawsuit, one of the earliest known web scraping lawsuits reported to the public, the lawsuit was filed against Bidger’s Edge, an online price comparison site for consumers, in 2000. According to the court order, Bidger’s Edge would not be able to scrape eBay content again. The most important reason eBay won this court was that Bidger’s Edge had proven to have exhausted its systems and that such websites could potentially cause further damage to eBay’s system. ‍ Facebook and Power Ventures Litigation : The main reason Facebook sued Power Ventures in 2009 was that the content uploaded by Facebook users was scraped by Power Ventures. As you can see from this case, web scraping was also evaluated in terms of intellectual property, and it was also an extremely important example in this field. Facebook had won the court, and Power Ventures was penalized financially. ‍ Linkedin and hiQ Lab’s Litigation : The most recent web scraping lawsuit, currently pending and not yet settled, started in 2019 and the parties were Linkedin and hiQ Labs. HiQ Labs, which LinkedIn sued, was a data analytics company that scraped public profiles for a professional skills analysis. Although the initial decision by the district court found hiQ Labs guilty, LinkedIn decided to file a new lawsuit in June 2021 and appealed to the Supreme Court. Since this case is the newest web scraping case, it could be quite influential for the future of web scraping in the US. What are the Latest Regulations for Web Scraping by Country? While there is great uncertainty about whether web scraping is legal yet, in this section we will go over with you how the United States, European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regulate web scraping. ‍ United States: There are no general laws against web scraping in the United States, as the deleted data is in the public domain and the scraping activity does not harm the website from which it was copied. Still, there has been a special law since 2016 against people who use bots and buy an excessive number of tickets at the same time to thwart black market sales. ‍ European Union and the United Kingdom: The European Union aimed to bring all European Union countries together under the Digital Single Market, where they would be subject to the same regulation, and soon after passed the Digital Services Act. According to the third and fourth articles of this regulation, scraping and duplicating publicly available content does not involve any illegality. In this arrangement, web scraping is approached more from an intellectual property perspective. Also, a web scraping project that contains personal data and aims to obtain that data would be illegal due to GDPR. All regulations, except for personal information, are the same as in the USA. ‍ China: According to the information written in English sources, there is no direct regulation preventing web scraping in China either. Like the intended use in other countries, the intended use in China is for business purposes. Also, scraping and using personal data is illegal in China as well as in European Union countries. You Shouldn’t Disrupt the Web and Perform Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks One of the first and most important things to consider when using a web scraper is that you often have to repeatedly query a website and potentially access a large number of pages. For each of the pages on this website, you must send a request to the server hosting the website, have the server process your request, and wait for it to send a response to the computer running your code. In response to each of these requests, the web server does nothing but respond to someone else trying to access the same site, so the resources on the server will inevitably be consumed slowly. If you send the same type of request more than once in a very short time, you can prevent other normal users from accessing the website during this request submission. You may even cause the webserver to run out of resources and crash, which is an extremely effective way to hack a website. In fact, some hackers even perform an intentional Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Although DoS attacks are extremely common in the internet environment, modern internet servers also have some measures to prevent the illegal use of resources in this way. It’s also worth mentioning that these modern servers are warier of large volumes of requests from a single computer or IP address. These web servers’ first lines of defense usually consist of rejecting requests from that IP address. Even if the web scraper you are using is used for legitimate purposes and you do not want to crash a website, it is possible to engage in similar behavior. If you don’t do web scraping carefully and don’t respect the existence of the website, you could get your computer and IP address banned from accessing a website. ‍ You Must Respect the Intellectual Property of Others As we told you before, in some cases web scraping can be extremely illegal and the penalties you will receive are not to be taken lightly. However, you should keep in mind that this situation may differ from country to country. If the terms and conditions of the website you want to scrape are such as to prevent its content from being downloaded and copied, and you scraped that website, you could be in serious trouble. In addition, as we explained in the previous section, you can use web scraping practically if you do not disturb the regular use of the website and if you take reasonable care of the website. However, if you scrape and use data from the website without permission from the copyright holder, you are in breach of copyright law. From a different perspective, web scraping is not much different from using a web browser to visit your website. You just use computer software to access publicly available data on the Internet, which is a scraper versus a browser. In addition, people who want to do web scraping need to be more careful and aware of the risk, as most laws see web crawling as very different from automated web scraping. In general, if the data you want to use is public, that is, if the recorded content is not the kind of content that is behind a password-protected authentication system, you may be able to scrape the data without breaking the standard use of the website. The situation you could potentially be blamed for is whether the scraped data will be shared again. If you have completely downloaded content from one website and posted it on another website, unless this is expressly permitted, you are infringing copyright. Web Scraping Code of Conduct in General: Rules to Follow for an Ethical and Legal Web Scraping If you want to create a legal and ethical web scraping project, you can ask the site owner to share the data, avoid downloading copies of documents that are not openly public, check your local laws, refrain from illegally sharing your downloaded content, share it with others if the data you have obtained is public And you can stay away from DoS attacks on websites. If you follow the rules listed below, you will be running a legal and ethical web scraping project. ‍ You can ask the website owner to share the data: If the data you need is such that you can get it from a website owned by a particular organization, you should try contacting that organization and asking them directly if they can provide you with what you are looking for. If you’re lucky, these people who already have the primary data they use on their website in a structured way will share the data with you and save you a lot of trouble. ‍ You can avoid downloading copies of documents that are not openly publicly available: An academic journal publisher has very strict rules about what you can and cannot do with their database. It can easily get you and perhaps your friendly university librarian in trouble, as it’s completely forbidden to download PDFs of articles in bulk. If you need a local copy of some documents for your project, you should meet and negotiate with the publisher. ‍ You can control your local laws: While some countries may do any kind of web scraping and there are no laws protecting them, other countries have laws that protect people’s personal information such as email addresses and phone numbers. Even getting this information from public websites is illegal. ‍ You can stay away from illegally sharing your downloaded content: Although some information is protected by copyright, as intellectual property is a fair use issue, there is no problem when you scrape it for personal purposes. However, sharing this information with other people or institutions after obtaining it is extremely illegal and has serious sanctions. ‍ If the data you have obtained is public, you can share it with others: If the data you have scraped is public data without any doubt and there are no legal barriers to sharing this data, you can share the data so that other people can use this data. If you want, you can also share the web scraper you wrote so that other people can benefit from it. ‍ You can avoid DoS attacks on websites: Since not all websites and their servers are designed to withstand thousands of requests per second, it would be unreasonable to send too many requests to these websites in a very short time. If you’ve written a recursive scraper, you’ll need to test it on an extremely small dataset to make sure it does what it’s supposed to do. You should also make the necessary settings to create a delay between requests.

Most languages ​​used in web development such as Python, Javascript, Ruby, Php have their own pros and cons. For example, in web scraping with JavaScript, you can take advantage of the language’s asynchronous nature. Thus, while the user scrolls the page, you can scrape even the data that seems not yet processed. Although JavaScript is familiar to both backend and frontend web developers, it can be a bit overwhelming if you are new to programming. You only need to manually add a headless browser call to the scrape handler when scraping with JavaScript. Therefore, through web scraping, you extract data from the website using a computer program that acts as a web browser. The program requests pages from web servers just like a web browser do, and may even encourage a user to log in to obtain a spreadsheet or database known as web scraping. There are software tools that can be used to customize web scraping solutions. Check out the examples below: iMacros iMacros is a browser extension for sharing, coding, recording, or replaying browser automation, also known as JavaScript. It is specially designed and optimized for form filling and web browsers. Diffbot It is a developer of computer vision and machine learning public APIs and algorithms for extracting data to extract data from web scraping. It uses computer learning and vision to automatically extract data from web pages by visually interpreting the pages as a human. HTTrack This is an offline web browser that can be used to open the source web browser for free. It allows users to download large websites from the internet and edits the original site’s relative link structure. Things You Should Know There are terms and conditions that apply when doing web scraping. ·   It is recommended that you read about the legal use of data, as the data you extract from the web should not be used for commercial purposes. ·   Since the layout of a website may change from time to time, be sure to revisit the site and rewrite your code as needed. ·   Do not be too aggressive when requesting data from the website as this may break the website. When you encounter this situation, you may be under a legal obligation. It is recommended to search one web page per second. How to Learn Web Scraping Techniques? There are several resources you can use to learn about web scraping. Your choice is deeply dependent on the programming language you know well. When it comes to web scraping, the main thing is to parse structured or unstructured HTML into structured data. Most programming languages can do this for you. With this information, you must first know the programming language you will be using, and then undertake the task of seeking resources for that language to accomplish the task. It is important to choose a language you speak to avoid learning curves. General Techniques Used for Web Scraping Web scraping is still an evolving process, but it proposes more practical solutions that build on existing techniques and compare applications with their ambitious counterparts. Web scraping techniques are as follows: 1. Copy paste: Copy paste sites are the only viable solution when they explicitly set the barriers to prevent machine automation. 2. Text pattern matching: It is one of the best and most reliable web scraping techniques. Text pattern matching includes different programming languages ​​such as PHP, Python, JavaScript, C++, and Ruby, and data is extracted from websites based on UNIX grep commands. 3. HTTP programming: It is possible to receive dynamic and static websites by sending different HTTP requests and using socket programming. 4. HTML parsing: It has an extensive collection of pages generated from underlying structured sources such as blogs and websites, databases. HTML parsing uses a program to detect HTML text from different sites. Converts from unedited form to an organized and readable format. HTQL and XQuery are two big data query languages. These are used to better parse HTML pages. Web pages can include metadata, descriptions, and semantic markup used to find specific pieces of data. If a description is added to a web page, this web scraping technique can be seen as a special case of DOM parsing. Best Programming Languages for Web Scraping You can easily perform multiple data scraping and web crawling tasks with PHP, Node.js, C++, and Python. Let’s see: Node.js: This language is great for web crawling and better supports distributed crawling. Node.js is not suitable for large-scale web scraping projects due to limited options and code. C & C++: Both C and C++ offer excellent performance, but the costs of developing web scrapers with these languages are high. Thus, C and C++ are not suitable for small and medium businesses. PHP: PHP is one of the best web scraping languages. It is used to create scanning programs and is easy to learn. Python: It would not be wrong to say that Python uses the most famous web scraping language. It can handle different data extraction and web crawling processes conveniently and smoothly. Popular Web Scraping Techniques We have discussed the general web scraping techniques and also popular programming languages which are used in web scraping. Now we will talk about the popular web scraping techniques! Manual Web Scraping, Copy-Paste We have mentioned this technique above. It has been the easiest technique for web scraping but not the best sometimes. All you need to do is copy the web content and paste it into your database. However, even though it seems easy; it could turn into something repetitive, meaningless, and something boring. On the other hand, copy and pasting will allow you to overcome the anti-bot defense. DOM Code Review Sometimes scrapers use DOM code to extract data deeply. This technique works best for dynamic websites. You will need some plus tools such as XPath to extract data while using DOM. Vertical Aggregation Vertical aggregation is generally used to scrape a specific company or customer. It is a great choice to work in the cloud and has high quality data. Also, it can be handled without human interaction. Google Sheets Scraping While Google’s API is a very popular tool for web scraping, its use is increasing. You can use the XML AL (,) function to collect the data you need from various websites. ‍"},

Content scraping is when a bot downloads most and all of the content on that website, regardless of the website owner’s wishes and copyrights. While content scraping is a data scraping method, content scraping is not data scraping. In this process, which is basically always performed by bots, it is possible to download all the content on a website within a few seconds. One of the most important reasons why content scraping bots scrape and obtain content is to repost content to increase SEO on the attacker’s website. As a result of this action, copyrights are violated, organic content is stolen and content can be reused for purely malicious purposes. In addition, some forms may need to be filled out and submitted to obtain the content. Why is Content Scraping Necessary? All e-commerce sites that want to be up-to-date with their competitors and want to learn about trends can collect the price data of those websites by scanning the data of other websites. Content scrapers can also be used to better evaluate the data they collect. Some websites may also request website content to publish on their websites and applications for free. We can share with you examples of content scraper applications as follows: A website owner can use a content scraper to increase the number and volume of pages on his website, and after obtaining this content, he can repost the same things on his website. You can use content scrapers to keep the content on their websites up-to-date, and by republishing the content obtained from these content scrapers, you can make the website appear to be renewed regularly. In addition, website owners can collect content and use the language switcher by defining the language of this content. After the language of the content is changed, the content will appear as completely original content, so it can be republished.

Bots, which are used to scrape all kinds of data such as text, images, HTML code, and CSS code that are publicly published on the Internet, transmit this data to its owner, and attackers have a chance to use the scraped data as they wish. The texts obtained by using content scraping bots can be reused on another website in order to steal the ranking of the first website on search engine results pages and to deceive internet users. The contents we have listed below are typical content that a content scraping bot can scrape. Blogs with thought-oriented and completely original articles Comprehensive product reviews on e-commerce sites Newly published news articles Technical research articles New listings are designed in a classified way and on places like job portals, real estate sites Publications that contain financial information and are the product of a research Product catalog on an e-commerce site The information of the sellers of a particular product on a particular website and the selling prices of the products Can Content Scraping Bots Be Abused? Let’s also mention that some of the people who use content scraper bots may be cybercriminals. These cybercriminals can use the HTML and CSS code of a website to gain the appearance of a legitimate website and increase the number of websites of a company. The general aim of cybercriminals is to make a website look real and it is aimed that users trust these websites. Immediately afterward, phishing can also be carried out by stealing the personal information of people who shop on this website. 7 Safe Scraping Techniques You Can Use to Scrape Content As a technique you can use if you want to scrape content from websites, content scraping has tools and services that you can easily obtain online. If you want to be proficient in content scraping, you need to really expertly know all the techniques of data scraping, or you can use a freelancer or an expert team for this. If you want to take advantage of automatic web scraping tools and services, you should know those lime proxies, cURL, Wget, HTTrack, Import.io, Node.js, and others are available. Scrapers used for scraping include headless scanners such as Phantom.js, Slimmer.js, and Casper.js. COPY-PASTING : If you are doing manual scraping, what you will do is copy the content of a website and paste it into another file. This process is extremely time-consuming and repetitive, making it ideal for small-scale projects only. In addition, a website’s defense is geared towards automatic scraping techniques rather than manual scraping techniques, so using a manual scraping technique is extremely effective. Although this is a huge advantage, automatic engraving is extremely fast and inexpensive, so manual engraving is generally not preferred. HTML PARSING : This scraping method is used for text extraction, screen scraping, and source extraction, as HTML parsing with JavaScript targets linearly advancing or nested HTML pages. In addition, this method is the fastest and most robust method for text, screen, and source scraping. DOM PARSING : DOM, short for Document Object Model, is a structure that defines the style structure and content of XML files. If you want to get a very detailed view of the structure of the web page, you should make use of DOM parsers. Additionally, you can use a DOM parser to get the nodes that give you information, and if you want to scrape websites as well, you should prefer a tool like XPath. If you are going to pars the DOM, you should use Internet Explorer and Firefox for this. VERTICAL AGGREGATION : Vertical aggregation platforms are actually only used by companies with large-scale computing power to target specific industries, and some companies prefer to run these platforms on the Cloud. Under normal circumstances, people need to create bots for certain verticals and scrape the web with the help of these bots. However, vertical aggregation platforms also perform web scraping and monitoring on their own, and these processes do not involve any human intervention. The quality of the bots created will vary depending on which sector they are in and for what purpose they are created. XPATH : XML Path Language used with XML documents, or XPATH for short, can be described as a kind of query language. XPath helps you select nodes based on different parameters, you can also navigate XML documents with ease using XPath which results in a tree-like structure. It is also possible to use it in conjunction with DOM parsing to scrape a website’s page as we mentioned earlier. GOOGLE SHEETS : Extremely popular among web scrapers and even one of the most popular, Google Sheets is a web scraping tool. If you want to scrape any data you want from certain web pages, just use the IMPORT XML (,) command. You should know that this method is a method you can use only when you need to scrape certain data or patterns from a single website. You can also tell if your website is reliable against scraping through Google Sheets. TEXT PATTERN MATCHING : Different programming languages ​​are used in the Text Pattern Matching method, where you need to use the UNIX grep command. This method is done by pairing with popular programming languages ​​such as Perl or Python. How to Easily Execute Content Scraping: Tips for Content Scraping Projects If you want to easily carry out content scraping, you should check for an API, be kind to the website, not follow the same crawl pattern and constantly change your crawl pattern, use CAPTCHA solution services, and scrape data during off-peak hours. 1. You should check if an API exists An API, or application programming interface, hides the complexity of the website from data consumers, and thanks to this interface, you can easily obtain the data you need using a simple program. If there is an API on a website, sending a search query to the API will be sufficient to obtain the data, it is also possible to take this data and use it as you wish. 2. You should be kind to the website Each time you make a request, the underlying website whose data you are targeting must use server resources to provide you with a response. For this reason, the volume and frequency of the queries you make will affect the servers of the website. Therefore, the higher the volume of requests you send to the servers of the website and the more frequent requests you make, the more the server of the website will be damaged and the user experience of the website will be seriously affected. If you want to be kind to the website, you should try these methods: If you have such a facility, it would be better to do web scraping during off-peak hours as the server load will be minimal compared to peak hours. When you scrape a website, you need to limit the number of requests you send. You need to send your requests to websites by dividing them into multiple IP addresses. If you are going to make consecutive requests, you should add a certain number of delays between these requests so that the website’s server is not overloaded. 3. You should not follow the same scanning pattern and constantly change your scanning pattern Although both human users and bots consume data from a website, there are some inherent differences between these users. Humans are extremely slow and future movements of humans are absolutely unpredictable, but unlike humans, bots are extremely fast and have predictable behavior. This is also the reality that anti-scraping technologies on the website use to block web scraping tools. For this reason, you can add random and man-made actions to your web scrapers to avoid anti-scraping technologies. 4. You should take advantage of CAPTCHA resolution services A service that companies use to avoid being scraped by other companies, the CAPTCHA service helps you understand whether the user on a website is real or a bot. If the users are real users and humans, they will be able to solve these puzzles easily, but if a bot is visiting the website, this puzzle will not be solved. However, if you want to have an advanced scraping process and you are going to provide a service for it, you need to take advantage of CAPTCHA solution services to get rid of CAPTCHA problems. 5. You should scrape data during off-peak hours If you scrape during peak hours when the website is frequently viewed, the server load on the target website will also be extremely heavy. For this reason, if you scrape during peak hours, you will cause a bad user experience for real users who scrape the website. If you want to deal with this problem, you can schedule your web scraping scheduled to occur during off-peak hours. If you need a web scraping service, Scrape.do is the right choice for you.

With data extraction, which is the process of collecting and retrieving data from various sources that are poorly organized or not completely structured, it is possible to collect and categorize different types of data. You can store, consolidate, process, and refine data more conveniently in another central location to transform the data obtained by data extraction. You can use internal storage to store and organize data, try find-based storage, or both. How Does Data Extraction Work? If you are looking for a data extraction service provider to use for your business, you should learn how this process works before hiring a service provider. Tools for data extraction are used to extract and collect data from unstructured sources such as websites, documents, or client databases, and are usually in the form of desktop tools or cloud-based web scraping tools. The result can be as simple as a CSV file or a fully interactive database that constantly updates the data you have and can show you how the data is distributed. With the data you will obtain by using data extraction services, you can make better decisions more easily, increase your productivity in business and increase your knowledge about the market.

If you think that even the smallest point of the pipeline can be affected by the data, you can understand how important it is to take advantage of the data extraction service. Using data, it will be possible to determine your business goals and examine the relationship between source data and data extraction. You can also bring out a combination of human analysis and machine learning using data extraction because you can make better decisions and analyzes data from any type of text. There are many reasons why the data extraction system is important, including the features we listed and mentioned above. We can list these reasons as follows: By using the data extraction system, you can easily extract data from texts that contain too much information and are too long to be read fully. Regardless of the format of the texts published on the Internet, you can extract information in another format. For example, you can combine PDFs, web pages, and word documents to create another PDF. You can convert the texts published in languages ​​that you do not understand into a single text and translate the texts into your native language in order to get information from these texts. Challenges You May Encounter During Data Extraction In addition to the accuracy and quality of the data, the difficulties you may encounter during data extraction may include not being able to prepare the content in the format you want. There is also the fact that the sources from which you can get the data you want to require extra access permission and the data are obtained incompletely. Let’s take a closer look at the most common challenges you may encounter during data extraction. 1. Data quality: Data quality, which is one of the most important elements in analytics, is one of the most common and most serious challenges during data extraction. Companies using data extraction services may also need to consider the issue of data quality in order to gain a better insight into what is going on in their business and to get a richer, more accurate picture. While you will have fewer problems with data quality when you extract data from multiple sources, you should keep in mind that data quality is one of the biggest challenges companies face in the digital age. 2. Lack of standardization: It is possible to obtain information from anywhere, anytime, but the information you obtain may not always be in the format you need. Since many companies store their data in a read-only way, additional software may be required. Although searching for information from different sources and using the data extraction service will save you time and money, you should make sure that the data you obtain is suitable for your needs and expectations. 3. Lack of access: In addition to being a daunting and costly process to find the right data, you may also encounter the problem of not being able to access the resources you want. Some websites may not have the resources you want, or the websites with the data you want may have a high paywall. For these reasons, you may not be able to benefit from the data on the websites as you wish. 4. Missing data: Although the data extraction process seems to be very simple and easy, we can say that the data extraction process is not always perfect. Although you will be able to access the correct information, it is possible that you may encounter errors and deficiencies during data extraction. Why Should You Use Data Extraction for Your Business? You can customize data extraction for your company according to your business needs and by using it, you can increase your efficiency, access the data you want more easily, save time and money, and get more accurate results. You Can Customize Data Extraction According to Your Company’s Needs You can customize the data extraction service according to the needs and future plans of your business. Using the data extraction service, you can search for the information you want in any source you choose, and you can even make a special edit for it. You can also decide how the data you obtain is displayed and how often the data is collected. You Can Increase Your Company’s Efficiency Using Data Extraction By using the Data Extraction system, you can obtain an automated system, thus allowing other employees in your workplace to do their work with a better quality way. You can also access data more quickly, as computerized systems can collect and sort data faster than humans can. You won’t have any trouble meeting deadlines because you can access information more quickly. It is also possible to extract data from PDF files in the data extraction system, where it is possible to even provide real-time access to the collected data. We all know how difficult and time-consuming it is to extract data from a PDF, it can be inefficient as working with a PDF is extremely demanding, and using a PDF extractor is time-consuming. Instead, you can access the data you want very quickly by using the Data Extraction system. With Data Extraction, It Will Be Possible For You To Access The Data You Have Obtained More Easily By creating a central data extraction system and using the data extraction method, it is possible for the personnel in your business to access the information they need when they need it. In addition to making the working life of the personnel easier, you can easily share data between the parties. By using an automated data extraction system, it is easier for your staff to have complete visibility into vital records, easier organization among employees, and workers no longer have to deal with the hassle of searching for documents and information. You Can Save Time and Money with Data Extraction Method Although it may seem illogical for you to pay for a system that already works automatically, that automatic system you will use will actually help you earn more money in the long run. You can perform tasks such as research, management’s analysis of data, and answering e-mails, which cause up to 8 hours per week and more than 10 weeks per year during year, without wasting time. You can also automate the data extraction process so that your staff can focus on another area and focus on creative work instead of boring work. Although it may seem like you have paid a high level of fees in the short term, you will realize that it is an extremely profitable method in the long run. In addition, we can easily say that you will spend less money by investing in an automated system rather than paying an hourly wage to an employee for information. By Using Data Extraction, You Get More Accurate Results That Is Free from Human Error We said that people can also be used during the data collection process and the whole process can be done manually. One of the biggest challenges during data collection is human error. By using automated systems instead of humans, you can collect the data you want and save time by examining only the data you need. In addition, you avoid transcription and transpose errors by using an automatic data extraction system. Using inaccurate data can cause serious problems for many businesses, so you should also take care to constantly update your automation software. Things to Consider When Finding a Reliable Data Extraction Service Provider You own a company and are you looking for a data extraction service provider to help your company achieve its business goals and future plans? Whatever service provider you find, you need to make sure it has a proven track record and a list of clients who are genuinely satisfied with the work done.

Keep in mind that the most trusted and best data extraction service providers work in partnership with leading database vendors and web scraping software developers.

You can use web scraping for price intelligence, market research, alternative data for finance, real estate, news, and content tracking, lead generation, and brand tracking. Let’s take a closer look at them now: Web Scraping Price intelligence : One of the biggest uses for web scraping, price intelligence is based on getting product and price information from e-commerce sites.

You can analyze markets around the world using high-quality and high-volume data of all shapes and sizes available on the Internet. Alternative data for finance : It is possible for investors to obtain alternative data in the field of finance with web scraping, which is really a good fit for investors. Investors need to be more precise in their decision-making, so they need to have a lot of data. All the world’s leading investment firms use web scraping to make better decisions and increase their earnings. Real estate : The digitalization of the real estate industry in the last twenty years and the destruction of traditional companies cause serious competition in the real estate industry. If you are an advertising agency and a brokerage firm, you should incorporate online product data into your own business and protect against online competition. For this, it would be most logical to use web scraping. News and content monitoring : Even a single news cycle in modern media can have a significant value or threat to the future of your business. If you own a company that works in the direction of news analysis or you are frequently seen in the news, you can watch the most critical stories in your industry with the news data you will get with web scraping. Lead generation : A very important activity for all businesses, lead generation is extremely important for marketing and sales. According to a 2020 report, the biggest challenge for marketers and companies was generating traffic and leads. But if you use web scraping, you can access structured leader lists from the web and put your business one step ahead. Brand monitoring : As almost everything happens online nowadays, protecting your online reputation should be your top priority so you can survive in this competitive market. If you sell your products online and have a strict pricing policy, you need to learn how your products are perceived. For this, you can find out the complaints and satisfaction of your customers about your products by using web scraping. Which Websites Should You Scrape: Top 5 Earning Websites! Actually, which websites you scrape is entirely up to you, but in this section, we have compiled the five most scraped websites for you and talked about why they are scraped. Let’s take a look at the top 5 most scraped websites: Google: Marketers working on Search Engine Optimization are the group of employees most interested in searches on the Google search engine. Marketers use web scraping to track data on Google search engine results pages to track certain keywords and obtain data such as the metadata of a web page that is shown in the results list for Search Engine Optimization and that has a critical impact on clickthrough rate. Yelp: With rankings and reviews for physical and online businesses that can be considered golden data, Yelp can tell you what customers think about any business when scraped. You can also learn how your business looks in the eyes of customers and use reviews for competitive analysis. Walmart: Walmart, whose motto is “Save Money, Live Better”, can qualify as one of the best targets to scrape because if you want to do web scraping, you also need to take advantage of price comparison sites. For retailers and businesses, scraping Walmart helps to get product data quickly and is highly qualified. eBay: One of the most popular e-commerce sites, eBay is also one of the most frequently scraped and valuable websites. By getting data from eBay, where there are many people who continue their own businesses, you can examine in detail what your competitors are doing and have information about the trends in the market. Amazon: The most scraped website, Amazon is also the most popular among e-commerce sites. It is possible to obtain information for all kinds of market research by scraping the data on this website, which has huge shares. By scraping from Amazon, which has the largest database, you can track prices, monitor your competitors, make better product selections and learn what your customers think about you. How Do You Scrape Data on the Internet with Two Different Methods? There are two different ways to scrape websites, do it yourself using web scraping tools and outsourcing. Scraping Web Using Scraping Tools If you are writing your own code to scrape websites and using Python, your web scraping process should be like this: As a first step, you must define the target website. Secondly, you should collect the URL addresses of the pages of the websites whose data you want to extract. Thirdly, you must request URL addresses to obtain the HTML address of the pages. Fourthly, you should use locators to obtain and scrape data contained in HTML. Finally, you should save all the data you have obtained in a reconstructed format to JSON, CSV, or a different format file. Although it seems like an extremely simple five-step process, this simplicity only applies to small projects. But if you want to manage a large-scale project, there are a lot of things you need to do like secure your web scraper, manage proxies, execute javascript and try to get rid of antibots.

Although this social media platform is not the most popular social media platform, Twitter is the social media platform with the best data for a business owners to reach the target audience they want. It is also extremely easy to communicate with your target audience using Twitter. According to an important recent study, Twitter users are 38% more likely to talk and tweet about a product or brand than users of other social media platforms. This means your customers are 38% more likely to talk about your products and brand, so scraping Twitter data makes perfect sense if you want to get their opinions. As Scrape.do, in this article, we talked about what Twitter data is, the Twitter data you can get using Twitter Analytics, the benefits of Twitter data for your business, and how you can use Twitter data for your business. Contact us to learn how you can use Twitter to improve your business and scrape Twitter data! Our customer support team looks forward to meeting you. Twitter Data You Can Obtain Using Twitter Scraping With Twitter Analytics and web scraping, Twitter’s built-in analysis tool, you can have more information than shares, Likes, and Retweets. With Twitter Analytics, the general public can gain insight in addition to people who need to engage with social media, such as advertisers and marketers. Businesses that have a limited budget and want to start an advertising campaign on social media and need important data for this can use Twitter Analytics. According to eMarketer, a major survey company, more than two-thirds of businesses use Twitter data to streamline their marketing efforts and create new strategies. In addition, this rate is expected to increase even more in a few years. The data you can get through Twitter Analytics can be analyzed in five sections: account home page, tweet activity, audience views, events, and more. 1. Account Homepage The account home page contains monthly analytics so account holders can view the performance of their content. These analyzes include tweets, number of tweet impressions, profile visits, followers, and mentions. The data in the account home page analysis is very useful in showing your profile traffic and views. You can analyze this data provided directly by Twitter on a monthly basis. Tweets This part refers to the total number of Tweets you have shared in a month. Tweet impressions This shows how many times your Tweet has been viewed on a user’s home page or in search results. These views include whether the Tweet has been viewed privately. Mentions This shows how much your Twitter account is used in other users’ Tweets. Profile visits This refers to how many people clicked on your profile through your tweets and through search. Followers The total number of followers you currently have and how many followers you have gained since last month. 2. Tweet Activity The tweet activity section, which provides a broad view of the organic display of your Tweets on a given day or period, shows impressions excluding promoted impressions. Thanks to the Tweets section, it is also possible to export all the data in your Twitter profile to a CSV file. In order to follow the trends and important changes and not fall behind the trends, you can review such information through an electronic file. You can also view the most liked, most replied Tweets on your profile. Impressions Information about how many of your tweets were shown is written here, promotional impressions are not included in these impressions. Engagement rate This refers to all interactions to your tweets divided by total impressions. Top tweet metrics You can view Tweets that are the best in their field for engagement. 3. Audience Feedback Your Twitter data will vary depending on the type of audience and the characteristics of your target audience. With Twitter Analytics, it is possible to view the analysis of your followers and organic target audience. In addition, in this section, it is possible to get information about the gender and interests of your Twitter followers, these analyzes are shown to you as a percentage. Showing data about your target audience as a percentage gives you a clearer view of the interests of your target audience on Twitter. There is no harm in using this information and data for your own benefit, and you can also add a benchmark audience for competitor analysis. After you choose your target audience, you’ll see: Top interests You can find out which areas your target audience is most interested in. Best language You can learn the language that your target audience uses most frequently from this section. Top interest type Here is what your audience is most interested in. Mobile footprint You can find out the device your target audience uses most frequently here. 4. Twitter Events Being related to the activities and activities related to your industry will put you one step ahead of your competitors. Naturally, you should check out Twitter’s events section and know when important events are and will happen. It is possible to see a summary of the most popular trends on Twitter in the Events section of Twitter Analytics, you can be one step ahead of your competitors by browsing this section. You need to be careful when tweeting about topics that are not related to your target audience and brand, and not related to your industry because there is no guarantee that your brand will be successful in random tweets. It would be most logical to use Twitter Analytics to learn about events and create new campaigns using these events section, instead of sending random tweets. 5. More Because Twitter is constantly trying to develop data collection tools, it sometimes fails to put its newly developed tools in a category. You can access Twitter Cards, Videos, Application Manager, and Conversion Tracking from this category, which is described as More. Twitter Cards With this section, you can access URL clicks, upload attempts, and Retweets from your Twitter profits. You can also see changes over time, card types, URL links, and Tweets. Videos (beta) Whether it’s an ad-shared video or a standard video, you can see the views, total views, total minutes viewed, and percentages of total views of your videos here. Application manager This section helps you add different applications to your platform to get more users and optimize your content. Conversion tracking With this section, you can monitor your viewers based on website behavior and enable your website tags to work in integration with Twitter. You can also use this section to learn how your campaigns and website updates affect your traffic on Twitter. How Twitter Helps Your Business? Twitter allows an entrepreneurial business owner to better promote his business and at the same time connect with his target audience. Using Twitter helps businesses with marketing, brand image management, and sales. How Twitter Helps Your Business With Marketing? While Twitter is not as big a platform as other social media platforms, Twitter has some unique advantages when it comes to marketing. For example, by examining trending hashtags, you can understand what people are complaining about, detect problems in your industry, and understand how to solve them. More importantly, you can also directly reach customers who are complaining by using these trending hashtags on Twitter. Using hashtags on Twitter helps your business a lot in terms of marketing, you can also create ads on Twitter. How Twitter Helps Your Business With Brand Image Management? Your brand image, which is of great importance on all social media platforms and which you must pay attention to, is through effective and good management of your social media accounts. Although social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook usually make use of visual data, this is not the case with Twitter, Twitter is a text-based social media platform. This is why feelings and ideas are more likely to be shared directly. Considering that many people use Twitter directly to share ideas on products, services, movies, and music, it makes sense to protect your brand image on Twitter. Moreover, when people are going to criticize something, it is likely that they will tag your account in the relevant tweet. That’s why opening a customer support account will help you improve and protect your brand image. How Twitter Helps Your Business With Sales? Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook usually place more emphasis on socializing, while Twitter cares about sharing ideas. By examining the average Twitter user’s timeline, you can learn about their views and beliefs about everything from politics to music to art. By learning about people’s personalities, beliefs, and opinions, you can easily identify people who might be interested in your business. It is also known that people who use Twitter share their opinions about a particular product or service more easily than on other platforms, so if you get your customers to leave nice comments about you, your sales will also increase. In addition to all these, you can also communicate directly with people who will be interested in your business. How to Use Twitter Data to Develop Your Business? Now that you’ve learned the importance of using Twitter for your business and the Twitter data you can get through data scraping, you can now learn how you can use Twitter data to improve your business. You Can Track Your Competitors With Twitter Data You can use Twitter data to track how competitors are making moves and track their progress. With the scraping you have done using Twitter usernames, you can get detailed information about the people who interact with this username, identify the interests of people, and more clearly identify the customer base you need for your business. When you use Twitter data to detect the problems of competing businesses with their customers, you can learn about these problems and make sure that you do not have these problems. With Twitter Data, You Can Build an Impressive Marketing Strategy When you have Twitter data, you can identify the most popular thought leaders and influencers in your industry and field, and scrape the thoughts of these people into a better roadmap. To identify which people are important and influential, you just need to understand which tweets people retweet the most and which tweets they respond to. If you gather information about the thoughts of these people who are popular and have impressive leadership in your field, you can understand the topics that may go viral in the future and you can create more interaction by tweeting about these topics. In addition, since it is easier to reach influencers on Twitter, you can offer these people money in exchange for promoting your business and, if accepted, apply an impressive marketing strategy. By Using Twitter Data, You Can Use Suitable Hashtags and Engage Your Audience When you log in to your Twitter account, you can find which hashtags are popular and trending topics in the corner, but because these topics change frequently, just looking at this section gives you a superficial perspective. Therefore, by doing web scraping, it would make more sense to determine which area your potential customers are talking about and which hashtags they use the most. If you talk in the areas where your potential customers often talk, you will attract their attention. You Can Follow Market Trends and Industry Changes with Twitter Data By using the data you have collected on Twitter, you can easily identify the changes in your industry, and you can keep up with the trends by following the current trends.

While many people think that there are many shady or illegal things about web scraping, there is actually nothing wrong with scraping except for personal data and intellectual property. Just as there are certain limits in many human activities, you need to stay within certain limits during this process, an example of these limits is the terms of service of the website. At Scrape.do we offer scrapers that can help you scrape any website you want within legal frameworks. With our scraping tools, which you can buy as a package according to your needs, you will be able to scrape the website you want quickly and efficiently without being caught. Contact us to learn more and take advantage of our packages! Common Mistakes About Web Scraping In order to learn about the legality or illegality of web scraping and what data to scrape, you must first learn the common misconceptions about web scraping and the truth of these misconceptions. While it is thought that web scraping is illegal, network scrapers operate in a gray legal area, web scraping is hacking, and web scrapers steal data, none of this is true. Let’s discuss the accuracy and falsity of this information together. Myth 1: Web Scraping Is A Completely Illegal Activity. Web scraping is not a completely illegal activity, but rather a mostly legal one, and the legality of this process depends on what you scrape and how. You can liken it to shooting a video with your phone. You’re perfectly legal to shoot a scene or video of consenting people, but you could run into legal issues if you’re shooting videos of an army base or people without consent. There is also no law or immutable rule that prohibits web scraping, but keep in mind that this doesn’t mean you can scrape anything you want and keep your scraped data. Myth 2: Web Scrapers Work in a Gray Legal Area. It is completely false information that web scrapers exploit the loophole of the law and operate as such. In fact, almost ninety percent of web scraping companies are just as normal as other companies that offer you services and get paid in return. There are also legal regulations and rules that web scraping companies must follow in order to do their job. While web scraping is not heavily and carefully regulated, this does not mean that web scrapers are exploiting the law or are illegal. Myth 3: Web Scraping is Exactly the Same Thing as Hacking. The term hacking has many different interpretations and people may interpret hacking according to their own ideas, but the accepted general meaning of hacking is to access a computer’s system and exploit this system according to your wishes in non-standard ways. Scrapers used in web scraping log into websites as a normal person would, that is when scrapers are used, any computer system is not accessed by non-standard ways. All the data you get while web scraping is publicly available data. Myth 4: Web Scrapers Are Used To Steal Data. We have already mentioned that web scrapers are used to collect data that is publicly available on the Internet, cannot gain access to computer systems, and do not attack computer systems. This information is also completely false, as web scrapers access publicly available data and public data cannot be stolen either. For example, if you went to a store and saw a beautiful phone, and wrote down the make and model of this phone to review or buy later, would you steal the information? Of course, you wouldn’t be stealing information. Learn More See more myths about web scraping. In that article, we are going to see the most popular myths about web scraping and the real truths behind them. Let's start exploring and updating our knowledge on web scraping. ‍ Data You Need to Be Careful With While Web Scraping We mentioned that it is perfectly legal to scrape publicly available data and save it somewhere for later review. But you should be careful with copyrighted data and personal data while web scraping. Personal Data Personal data is known as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The existence of personal data is accepted by Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and laws in many states in America, and it has been decided that some personal data should be fully protected. Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Data may include: Name and surname Address info Date of birth and place of birth Contact information, mobile phone number Employment information, address of the place of work Ethnicity Personal medical data Financial information According to the laws of many countries, it is completely illegal to scrape, collect, use and store Personal Identifiable Data without the express consent of the owner. It should be noted that there may be legal exceptions in this regard in some countries. If you are doing a web scraping it is extremely difficult to get the consent of the person whose data you are collecting, and you should not scrape that data as it is also completely illegal to collect Personal Identifiable Data without the express consent of the owner of the data. So when scraping data on a website, it would be the best move to not scrape Personal Identifiable Data. Otherwise, you may face legal regulations. Copyrighted Data The right to use and reproduce all copyrighted data belongs to businesses or people who legally own that data. Here are some examples of this data so you can avoid it, as scraping this type of data can often cause problems: Photos were taken by photographers Traditional or digital drawings of painters Databases of some companies Songs Published articles Almost all copyrighted data can be found easily online, in fact, they are copyrighted data because they are easily accessible. It is completely illegal to use this data of your own will without the express permission of the copyright owner, but there is a fine detail at this point. While it is completely illegal to publicly use copyrighted data without the consent of the owner, it is not illegal for you to scrape and collect this data alone. Keep in mind, though, that the rules and laws in all countries are not the same, in some areas you may not be able to access any of the copyrighted data, while in others you may be able to use some. What Do European and US Laws Say About Web Scraping? We mentioned above that GDPR and CCPA are laws to protect personal data and Personally Identifiable Information cannot be collected illegally. These two laws have strict rules about Personally Identifiable Information. Although there are other details in the work, each region can have different rules. Now let’s look at what European and US laws say about scraping Personally Identifiable Information with Web Scraping. European Laws GDPR, which became enforceable in 2018 and is an important law on the use of personal information, applies to the use of people residing within the European Economic Area (EEA). If you want to scrape the data of people in the European region, there is no article for the protection of anonymized data in this law, which you should definitely take a look at. This is where GDPR comes into play if the data of people living in the European Economic Area is obtained by data controllers and this data is transmitted to data processors. GDPR has regulations covering the protection of personal information regarding web scraping, including data stored in cloud storage. If data in a company has been stolen and that company is operating in compliance with GDPR, both the people whose data was stolen and the authorities responsible for protecting the data are informed. After this information, businesses need to understand why there is a violation and plan what steps to take to prevent the violation. In addition, the amount and categories of all information compromised during these transactions should be communicated to the necessary authorities. Important note: Since companies located in the European Economic Area are GDPR compliant, it is completely illegal to scrape Personally Identifiable Information on the websites of companies located in this region. US Laws There is no absolute federal privacy law in the USA, so it is possible to scrape the websites of all businesses in the USA. However, there are many points that you should know before you dance with joy and joy. In the United States, there is a patchwork that can be qualified as proof of concept for federal use by the United States Congress, and this patchwork contains the laws of many states. For example, CCPA is used to prevent the Personally Identifiable Information of people living in the state of California from being scraped. There is also the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 throughout the US. (Thanks to these two laws, the health information and financial information of people living in America are protected.) Comparison of European and US Laws It is extremely difficult to compare and contrast European and US laws as to whether web scraping itself and the practice of web scraping are legal. This is because the data security laws of people living in Europe are protected by a single law (GDPR), while there is no federal law in the USA, and individual states come up with laws to protect consumer privacy. For example, CCPA, a law proposed for the state of California, is the most comprehensive and internet-focused law in the USA. There is even a detailed list of the contents of Personally Identifiable Information in this law. Examples in this list include browsing history, geolocation, biometric data, email, and employee information. Although other states in the USA have taken action to introduce such laws, they did not have a law as comprehensive as the state of California. Both the CCPA and the GDPR are laws that allow individuals to prevent the use of their data voluntarily. It is also possible for individuals to remove their data at any time and access their data again. The most important difference between GDPR and CCPA is that CCPA requires privacy statements on all websites, while GDPR requires explicit user consent. How to Be a Web Scraper Ethical and Legal? Most of the bad things you’ve read about web scraping are untrue, but there are still many things to watch out for. We mentioned that these issues are not scraping personal data and data protected by copyright. But if you want to have both a legal and ethical web scraper, make sure your web scraping and web scraper have these features: Your web scraper should act like a bona fide person browsing the internet. It should not overload the website for which data scraping is intended and targeted, but should protect the website. All data you scrape and store must be publicly shared. In addition, the data you obtain should not be protected by any password. All the data you scrape should be based on real information, not contain any fake information. The data you obtain with web scraping must not infringe any other person’s rights or copyrights. If the data you get with web scraping is used for your business, it should be used to create a new and tailored product. (Web scraping, which is used to steal another business’s market share, aims to attract users and create a product similar to the target website is unethical.) If you want your web scraping tool to work completely ethically and legally, you can get help from Scrape.do. With our support team, who will take care of you whenever you need support, you will not be exposed to any legal problems and you will have quick access to all the information you want and also need, without sharing your identity with the target website! ‍"},

Let’s move on and get some recent info about it, right before contacting us to offer you web scraping services! In today’s world, as technology advances and websites are more popular than ever, data has become the most valuable asset, because we do almost everything online and we can share our opinion on everything over the internet. It is possible for you to make competitive decisions that can support your business, even if you have enough ideas about competition and changing market trends. But where will you find the data to improve your business and yourself, and to make future plans? In the times when the internet and data scraping was not very popular, data collection was done through surveys, so it took an extremely long time to collect this data. However, today web scraping is an extremely popular and functional method where you can access all the data in the field you want with a few clicks of a button. It’s also possible for new businesses to emerge, as web scraping has become so popular and is a must-choose method for people selling products online.

What are you waiting for to contact us? We are ready for you and your projects. Come on, let’s walk this road together! What is Web Scraping? Web scraping, a process that can be done both manually and automatically, is generally preferred by companies and the most important reason for using this process is the possibility of making smarter decisions. Companies also use web scraping for purposes such as scrutinizing competitors’ prices, profiling their own customers, collecting contact information from potential customers for lead generation, and targeted advertising. It makes sense to use an automated web scraping process, as manually extracting data is extremely tedious and difficult, and can also lead to an inaccurate evaluation of the data. Using the web scraping method, you can take advantage of thousands of data points on the internet and collect clues in any area. When you examine all the data as a whole, you will have a combined insight and market trend. Now that we know what web scraping is, let’s take a look at the two different components of web scraping, web crawler, and web scraper: Web Crawler: A web crawler, which looks like a human exploring the internet and discovers the data on the internet by searching, and proceeding through the relevant links, is an artificial intelligence application. Before starting any web scraping project, it is extremely important that you crawl a website with a specific URL address with a web crawler. Just as you can’t do web scraping without a web scraper, you can’t do it without a web crawler. Web Scraper: With the web scraper tool, which is designed to extract data from websites extremely quickly and accurately, you can view the data you want in a single file and examine your data as you wish, with an accuracy rate close to ninety percent. All types of web crawlers need a web scraper. While the web crawler examines the data in the web browser, the web scraper processes the code and then collects the relevant data and combines it into a single file. Top 9 Web Scraping Projects Although web scraping may seem like a process that will only help companies, it is actually a process that can benefit anyone who needs data. You can also be sure that people selling the data also benefit immensely from web scraping, as web scraping also creates new job opportunities for people. We have told you the 9 best web scraping projects that you can generate income using the web scraping method or show on your CV when applying for a place. Web Scraping Ideas - 9 Ways to Start 1. You Can Offer People a Web Scraping Service If you own a web scraper, you can offer the web scraper you own to serve people and help people who need large amounts of data meet their needs. Whatever the field, data is valuable enough to be useful to people who want to grow their businesses. By offering your web scraping services to other people, you can enable people to access this extremely valuable data they want to have, and you can reach what you want while they get what they want. Let us help you better understand this project by exemplifying it with a small fitness service. A fitness service may be looking for private trainers to join and run their gym, it makes the most sense to use web scraping as researching private trainers one by one can be extremely challenging. With a web scraper, it is possible to learn the names of the best trainers in the city, their fees, contact information, experience level, hours they work, and the satisfaction level of their customers. When a fitness service uses web scraping, they can make a more informed decision and make people happy with their gym. Although the customers you can find for web scraping may seem like only the close circle or a certain circle, you can discover opportunities by taking advantage of freelancer sites such as Upwork and Fiverr. Websites like Fiverr and Upwork will both help you meet the best customers and ensure you get a very reasonable fee for your service and effort. 2. Using Your Web Scraper, You Can Catch Lowest Prices and Resell Products The outdated marketing tactics of product price drops such as discounts, last-minute deals, and lightning offers can be more effective than you think. If you make it a habit to review websites regularly, you will notice that you often encounter such low-price opportunities. If you’ve seen a really lucky drop in the price of a product that’s in high demand and bought it, you can sell it for its own price or for a much lower price. When purchasing premium products and limited edition products, you should pay attention to their low prices. When you sell these products later, they will attract attention as they are highly coveted and difficult to obtain, and they will be sold at the price you want. With this way, which is one of the best ways to earn income by using a web scraper, you can save yourself for a short time or you can continue your life by adopting this income and making sales in this way. It is entirely up to you for what purpose, how long, and how you will use this project model. 3. You Can Take Advantage Of Arbitrage Opportunities By Using Web Scraping While you can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities using web scraping, it would be more helpful to talk about what arbitrage is before talking about this project. Arbitrage is the process of people who buy securities such as stocks, bonds, and foreign currency that had a higher price some time ago but are now extremely low in value, and then sell these securities while they are gaining in value. In other words, arbitrage is the process of buying cheap and promising valuable papers, and selling them when the value of these valuable papers rises again. If you think you’re good at web scraping and you have a good enough web scraper, you’ll probably find that many companies seeking a competitive advantage will want to work with you. But why make money just by selling your services, when a more profitable way is possible? You can increase your income very easily by using the arbitrage method and scraping the right data. Learn More See if web scraping is beneficial for your business. It will be extremely beneficial for your business to automatically perform your data-related tasks by using web scraping and data extraction services. In the meantime, your employees who save time can … ‍ 4. You Can Do Research and Sell This Data With Web Scraping Even though the benefits of web scraping are seen as just getting data, you can actually bundle the data you get with web scraping and sell this data, you just need to specify the research topic and the websites you want the data from. Since academic and research institutes are always looking for lots and lots of different data, you can try to sell your data to academic and research institutes. You can even get original information and insights that may be more valuable than the data you dig, and you can use these insights in your life. 5. You Can Make Price Comparison Sites Using Web Scraping When most people search for something online, the first place they look is by logging into a website where they can compare product data and prices on different websites. These websites are an ideal way to start a project and it has continuity, but if you want to have the best project in this regard, you will need to upgrade your own project so that they can only find the purchase in a certain category. If you want people to benefit more from the data on your website, it would be logical to analyze the data. People do not prefer to spend a lot of money as they like to save money for their future and they often search multiple websites for the same product to find the best deal they can find before purchasing a product online. Since there are many people who gather and analyze all this data, you may prefer to collect all the information in one place and update it regularly. In this way, you will make people’s lives easier and you will have signed a great project that you can add to your CV. Let’s reinforce it with an example so that you can better understand this subject and the project. When people want to find the best tablet they can buy for the lowest amount, you can create a website that will pop up. To design the data on this website, you should scrape the data for all tablets available on Amazon and create a comparison in terms of both pricing and customer satisfaction. In this way, you will be able to build a dataset where people can get the best value for money. You can also start using a filter system where you can specifically filter the products with fewer or more comments on your website. 6. You Can Uncover Market Opportunities with Web Scraping Web scraping can be used to identify market opportunities, find new products or product innovations, and understand customer needs. This enables companies to offer new products that meet consumer expectations. So you can use web scraping to identify market opportunities and gaps in your product presentation. 7. You Can Scrape Leads With Web Scraping If you know anyone who owns a business, you can help them by creating a lead database for their company. First, talk to them about the types of leads they’d find valuable. After that, use your web scraper to gather lead data from the internet to build a database for them. 8. You Can Create Apps You might be a little nervous about this project. However, creating an app that requires you to set up a web scraper is actually pretty simple. The purpose of the app is to scrape a few specific stocks from Yahoo Finance every day and store that information in a Google Spreadsheet, which will then send you an email when any stock falls below a certain price. You can use this data to create something much more complicated—for example, an app that lets people know when the price of items they’ve saved on their wishlist drops. Or an app that tracks when airline prices decrease. 9.

Let’s see how to prepare yourself for this work! Web scraping, which is often used for purposes such as price tracking, enriching models used for machine learning, collecting data to be used in financial fields, tracking consumer emotions, and gathering information about news, takes large amounts of data from websites. Although internet browsers can show you the content on the websites as well as bring the data to you, it will be extremely tedious and time-consuming to constantly collect different data from different sources manually. Using web scraping, you can automate this manual process and easily extract data from websites. In this article, we told you about the basics of web scraping, why web scraping is used, what skills you need for web scraping, and why you should learn web scraping.

You can be sure that we will not regret you. ‍ Web Scraping Fundamentals Web scraping, which can also be referred to as crawling or spider web, is the process of collecting data from an online resource on a predetermined website, and this process is carried out completely automatically. Even though web scraping is a great way to help you get a large amount of data in an extremely short time when done automatically, the server where the source of these contents is located will be extremely stressed. Server owners, knowing that servers will be under stress, do not allow many websites to put them all together and prohibit web scraping. However, web scraping can be used and acceptable as long as it does not impair the primary function of the online resource, i.e. the website. Although web scraping has legal difficulties, it still continues to be popular and used. The most important reason why web scraping is used so much is that analysts need this data in an organized way. Considering that the various learning model and analytics engine is gaining more importance, people need to get raw data. Web scraping, on the other hand, continues to be used by anyone who needs raw data, as it is the easiest way to gather information. ‍ Why Use Web Scraping: Four Typical Web Scraping Practices Although web scraping can be used in almost any area you can think of, we have mentioned the four most typical web scraping applications in this section. These applications can be listed as social media sentiment analysis, e-commerce pricing, investment opportunities, and machine learning. Let’s take a brief look at them now: Social media sentiment analysis: Even though social media posts have a short shelf life and almost the majority of posts lose their popularity in just a few hours, we can see how society tends when we look at social media posts collectively. Although many social media platforms use APIs that allow 3rd party tools to access data, such data may not be enough for you. If you want to do social media sentiment analysis, you should scrape social media sites and take a detailed and real-time look at trending emotions, expressions, and topics. E-commerce pricing: Since the products of e-commerce sellers are listed on more than one website, it is necessary to examine more than one website at the same time to perform a price analysis on a product. Because manual scraping is extremely difficult, you can use web scraping to monitor product pricing across multiple platforms and choose the market where you can maximize your profits. Investment opportunities: Real estate investors need to do a lot of research to discover promising neighborhoods before they can invest. Although there are many ways real estate investors who need a lot of knowledge in this field can use to obtain data, the best and fastest method is web scraping. By using web scraping, it is possible to obtain valuable information, such as on websites that list places where travelers can stay. In addition, using the information in these accommodation places, the highest rated accommodation can be examined and the opportunities that people who use the accommodation service are looking for can be determined. Machine learning models: Web scraping is used so that machine learning models that need raw data to improve themselves and develop in general can continue and sustain themselves. With web scraping tools, a large number of data sources can be scraped in an extremely short time, and it is possible to have various data as texts and images can also be scraped. As machine learning models fuel technologies such as driverless cars, space flight, and image and speech recognition today, the accuracy and reliability of these models need to increase, and this requires accurate and raw information. ‍ What Skills Are Needed For Web Scraping? Want to scrape data from the internet but don’t know what skills you need to learn web scraping? So, in this section, we will talk about what skills are needed, how you can have these skills and how you can master these skills, and how people use these powerful skills in their daily lives. Before you start, let’s say that the things you need to do to learn web scraping are to learn the programming language, acquire HTML, CSS, and JS coding skills, and inspect the elements on the web page. Now, with your permission, we can begin. You Must Learn a Programming Language for Web Scraping To learn Web scraping, which is a purely software-based process, you need to know and be proficient in at least one of the popular programming languages ​​such as Python or Ruby. If you want to make money from the internet and you are going to use web scraping for it, make sure that these two programming languages ​​are in your portfolio. We can also list and explain the programming languages ​​you can learn for web scraping as follows: Node.js: One of the best programming languages ​​to use if you want to do web scraping or crawl data, Node.js can also be used to index different web pages in a single directory. You can also run a distributed crawl and perform web scraping projects at the same time with Node.js. However, it should be noted that the node.js programming language is only suitable for basic web scraping projects and is too plain to be used for large-scale projects. C and C++: The most commonly used programming languages, C and C++ are programming languages ​​that are extraordinarily good and useful for web scraping as they provide a great user experience. You can easily use these languages ​​to build a basic web scraper, but let’s just say that these languages ​​are not suitable for building a web browser. PHP: We can easily say that PHP is the best programming language for web scraping. Also, the PHP programming language is the most detailed program that can be used to develop powerful web scrapers and web scraper extensions. Python: As an expert in Python, which is one of the most popular and best programming languages ​​for web scraping just like PHP, you can easily handle multiple data crawling and web scraping tasks at the same time, and you don’t need to learn complex codes to do web scraping with Python. Three of Python’s most famous and widely used frameworks are Requests, Scrappy, and BeautifulSoup. Although Request is less well-known than Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, it also has many different features that can make your job easier. The Scrapy framework, which is a good alternative to Import.io, is used to scrape data from dynamic websites. The last and most popular framework, BeautifulSoup, is an extremely powerful Python library with which you can run efficient and high-speed web scraping projects. You Must Acquire HTML, CSS, and Javascript Coding Skills for Web Scraping We mentioned that web scraping uses browser-enabled JavaScript libraries. At the same time, web scrapers help you scrape data from websites that use any structure of HTML and CSS tag structures. The more you know about this process and the more you repeat this process, the easier it will be for you to identify and scrape data from websites. You also need to know that websites are made up of several different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. To acquire coding skills, you must thoroughly learn how HTML, CSS, and JS work. You Should Learn How To Inspect Elements On A Web Page For Web Scraping If you want to do web scraping, you must examine and identify the web page elements displayed on a website. Pages on websites may contain many, sometimes thousands, and sometimes more tags. Going through each of these tags one by one and manually trying to find what you’re looking for would be a waste of time and a truly near-impossible action to succeed. If you are wondering how to inspect elements on a web page, you can use Web Developer, Firebug, Webkit Inspector, or similar Inspectors. If you have also learned how to inspect elements, you can start using web scraping as the next step. If you have these features and skills that we have listed for you, you should be ready to get your hands dirty and write a few lines of code using one of the programming languages ​​you have learned. ‍ Why Should You Learn Web Scraping: Job Opportunities for Web Scraping Now that you’ve learned what skills you need to be able to do web scraping, it’s time to know why you should learn to do web scraping. We can explain why learning web scraping is important through job opportunities. Now, in order to understand and explain these business opportunities more easily, let’s examine them in a list: According to data collected from LinkedIn, Web scraping experts are sought in 54 different industries. If you want to learn which areas you can work in after learning web scraping, we can say that the first areas you can apply are Computer Software, Information Technology and Services, Financial Services, Internet, Marketing and Advertising, Computer and Network Security, Insurance, Banking, Management Consulting, and Online Media. If these areas don’t interest you, you can also use your web scraping skills to find employment in industries such as Oil and Energy, Construction, Consumer Goods, Defense and Space, Personnel and Recruitment, Hospital and Healthcare, Education Administration, and Government Administration. Although people think that this skill can only be used in computer and technology fields, since web scraping is an activity done with the help of codes and technology, they are really wrong. Although it is extremely surprising, we can say that the job fields you can find once you have web scraping skills include human Resources, marketing, business development, research, sales, and consulting. When we take a look at the publicly available data published on Glassdoor, salaries for various jobs range from $25,000 to $203k. Among these jobs, the highest-paying occupations are those that require web scraping skills, such as senior data engineer and data scientist. In other words, when you add web scraping skills to your skills, you can easily see that your monthly salary will increase exponentially. When we look at the data published on Glassdoor, we can easily see that the computer and technology sector is among the ten best paying sectors. With your web scraping skill, which you can use to get involved in this sector, you can start to get seriously high salaries. Considering the data we have obtained, we can clearly say that if you want to work in a technology company, you must have web scraping skills. While researching this data, we benefited from the data in the job postings of Google, a technology giant company with highly professional web scraping experts in the field of Software and Information Technologies. Youtube, which is also a subsidiary of Google, is also known to hire people with high-level web scraping skills in different job categories. Although Google places great emphasis on web scraping expertise in whatever field they hire, web scraping experts who apply to YouTube can work in Marketing and Communications, Software Engineering, Partnerships, Product and Customer Support, and Business Strategy. ‍ If you do not want to pursue a career in web scraping and all you need is a web scraper, you can contact us and take advantage of our web scraping service where we can offer high performance at extremely low fees.

You can contact our expert staff both for this issue and for other issues, and you can review our website for more content. Now, without wasting any more time, let’s move on to our article! What is Web Scraping? Web scraping is the process of scraping data on one or more websites, either through various browser extensions or through programs written by experts. Various individuals, organizations, and businesses use web scraping for different reasons, and it is very important to the continuity of a business. Today, using this technology and this method, businesses can create their potential customers. So how do I do this? We will cover exactly that in this article. Lead information is found almost everywhere on the internet today, from websites to social media platforms. The more successful you are in collecting and using that information, the more successful your sales efforts and lead generation efforts will be. You can also determine where your potential customers will come from through web scraping. This has a direct impact on lead quality, with better customers returning more sales to businesses. On the other hand, you are unlikely to know the source of the lead list that was purchased from someone else. How Can You Build a Lead Audience with Web Scraping? One of the most basic purposes of generating leads is the goal of making a profit. As we mentioned above, customers are very important for every profit-making business. Every for-profit organization needs customers who are willing to buy the goods and services it produces at the prices it determines. The web scraping process that comes into play here is a great way to make sure the customers you’re in contact with are genuinely interested in buying what you’re selling. It allows you to narrow down your target by sort of pinpointing the type of business and location you are targeting through web scraping and helps you customize your lead generation process to suit the right audiences you intend to market to. If you want to learn more about building a customer base by pinpointing this way, be sure to review the rest of our article and check out other content on our website. First, the first step in lead generation will be to determine exactly what resources you will be using. To do this, you need to determine, find and define which channel of the internet your target customer group is in. Remember, as this process continues, you should constantly ask yourself, “ Who is my target customer group ?” You must keep asking questions like_: If you patiently and wisely answer the questions you ask yourself, you will avoid reaching the wrong customer base and this will prevent a great deal of waste for you and your business._ While applying this step, scraping the information on the websites of rival companies will give you a great advantage. In addition, using this method allows you to learn about what your potential customers look like and will look like. The second step we will take will be the data extraction process. The data extraction process, as the name suggests, is a process related to data collection. You need to know where to find your target customer base. The main reason why we will do this operation is the necessity of obtaining data for the transactions we will perform later. You can obtain this information in three different ways. The first would be to create your own web scraping program. This will be the most grueling, as you will be creating a program from scratch. However, this is the most efficient method. This process will naturally take time. The second method would be to use an already existing scraping program. Since this method can be used without coding knowledge, it is more useful than the previous one, it is more preferred and naturally takes less time because you do not have to make your own code. At the same time, the cost will be very low. The third method is to partner with third parties to scrape data. Here you can get help from an expert. We can say that this is the least time-consuming method, but compared to the first two methods we have mentioned, it will be more costly since you will have to pay a person. However, you can reach more accurate data because you get help from an expert, that is, the person doing the work is an expert in his job. Whichever method you choose, you will surely get all the data you need to build your potential customer base. If you have difficulty in making a definite decision about which method is more suitable for you, you can contact us or review our website.

You can contact us to get support from … The process to Remember: Configuring Extracted Data Let’s say you have completed your data extraction. At this point, we can’t say you’re done. Because our next action is very important. This is the process of cleaning and configuring the data you have extracted, that is, making them functionally usable and useful to you. Data on their own makes almost no sense, but can be highly functional if cleared and structured. You must first extract the data that you have extracted through various programs. After extracting, you can rearrange this data through the configuration process and format your data to work for you. Several web scraping tools offer you to configure your scraped data. Instead of getting support from a software in this regard, you can do the configuration yourself or get support from an expert. If you do not trust your own coding or technical knowledge or do not have time to deal with it, getting support from an expert will save you time, even if it is a costly method. What Needs to be Done to Generate a Potential Customer Audience with Extracted Data? You have extracted and structured your data. So what exactly will this data do for you? Why did you obtain this data? As a matter of fact, these two questions have answers that are directly related to each other. You guys obtained this data to generate leads, this is the answer to the second question. When you look at the first question based on the answer to this question, you can see for yourself what this data will do. In general, you use this method to market the goods and services your business offers more easily and with less effort. The well-known saying “Every supply creates its own demand.” His statement is true in a way. However, how much supply you will provide determines how much demand is in the market. If you find the equilibrium point of the market, that is, equalize the amount of supply and demand, in other words, if you optimize it, you will have made a kind of perfect transaction. It’s nearly impossible to predict this balance point without technologies like web scraping. Think about it, is it safer to work based on guesswork and intuition to build your customer base, or based on actual data that already exists? The answer, of course, is to work with data. Web scraping isn’t the only way to understand customers and generate leads. But the least costly and most reliable way today is web scraping. This is the method that every emerging business in today’s digital age should and probably uses. Whatever your industry is, this method is extremely important for your business to survive. But what else can be done with web scraping? More precisely, what other ways can one benefit from web scraping? In the remainder of our article, we’ve covered things about it. It’s Not Limited To That: What Else Can Be Done With Web Scraping? What you can do with web or data scraping is not limited to just building a customer base. If we need to talk briefly, you can monitor prices from various electronic trading platforms (such as Amazon), calculate the financial risk data of customers in the field of finance, follow your customers’ thoughts and feelings about your company, events, changes, and innovations in your industry, and you can secure your place in the industry and move it up. In fact, we can say that as a recommendation, do not leave the potential customer pool after you create it. If you want to secure your place in your sector and maybe even raise it, even more, it will be to your advantage to benefit from the blessings of technology. For example, if some of your customers have a negative opinion about your company, you can quickly find out and please them. In addition, you will be informed about the developments in the sector much faster. Many more advantages like this will positively affect your place in the industry thanks to web scraping technology. Web Scraping vs. Traditional Methods In the past years, creating a potential customer base could be done with various marketing methods for long periods and without any guarantee, by taking higher risks. But nowadays there is a simplified version of this and it is with web scraping. Web scraping has become one of the most well-known and powerful methods of our time, as it offers businesses the opportunity to save time and money in this regard, as well as having relatively less risk compared to traditional methods. For example, if the customer information of competing companies is public, you can take advantage of it. One of the reasons why it is faster and more reliable than the old methods is that the data is open to everyone on the internet. Keeping the data of each customer without technology such as the internet is a very difficult and challenging task. In summary, web scraping is a process that simplifies all these processes. Unlike traditional methods, it requires less time and cost. Again, unlike traditional methods, it provides more reliable information. Using the innovations and opportunities required by the time, no matter what time period or age, provides an incredible advantage in the sector compared to your competitors who do not use it. What we mean is, if you compare a business that aims to create a potential customer base without using this technology today, and a business that aims to create a potential customer base using this technology, you will see that the business that uses this technology can be much more successful in its field.

Amazon, one of the largest shopping sites in the world, has millions of products, and people who want to enter e-commerce generally prefer Amazon because of the opportunities it offers. So scraping data from Amazon will help you analyze the competition, determine the ranking of your product, analyze the top reviews and reach your target audience. You Can Analyze Competition : If you are going to make a commercial decision, the first thing you should do is competitive analysis. Using the Amazon Scraping method, you can scrape the data of products on this website and develop or improve your marketing strategy. You Can Increase Your Product’s Ranking : If you want your product to have the highest sales rates, you should know that your product should be ranked higher. By scraping the data of the products in the first place, you can find the elements that are in those products but not in your products, and by adding these elements to the descriptions of your own products, you can make your products rank higher. You Can Review Top Reviews : If you want your products to rank high on Amazon, your product reviews must be good because Amazon is an e-commerce site that attaches great importance to customer satisfaction. In order to take your products to the top, you should review both positive and negative reviews of your customers and try to increase the number of positive comments by correcting the negative aspects. The more satisfied your customers are with your products and the higher ratings they give your products, the higher Amazon will rank your products. You Can Have a Targeted Customer Audience with Amazon Scraping : Each seller has a certain customer base based on the products they sell, and this customer base usually does not change unless the category of products sold does not change. (For example, the target audience of a seller selling in the field of technology is technology enthusiasts.) Knowing about the priority preferences of your customers on Amazon can help you increase your sales.

Whatever you want to learn with scrape processes, you can review our website or contact our expert staff directly. With our 10-minute average response time, we do not keep our valued customers waiting and we guarantee satisfaction! What is Social Media Data Scraping? Web scraping, which we have examined many times in other content on our website, is the name of the process using various tools or intermediaries to collect the necessary data over one or more websites. When we come to the social media part of the job, we do this by using social media web scrapers. Since the said scraping process is usually carried out automatically by various programs, it saves time, effort, and cost. Of course, it is also an option to do the scraping process manually rather than automatically. It is generally preferred when much more specific data is needed. However, the option to do it manually will of course mean more time and more effort, especially if you have someone else do it. When the engraving process will be done manually, it will be relatively more difficult than the automatic processes in general. So much so that in many cases a person may not be able to overcome it. When you think about it, it is very difficult to analyze each data on a website one by one and turn each one into a format that everyone can understand. Social media web scrapers are available so that we don’t endure these difficulties and don’t waste too much effort and time. Although we can say that such programs are generally simple to use, it will always be to your advantage to have some technical knowledge. When using many programs, all you have to do is to command the scraper what information to scrape. After you give this command, the scraper will scrape all the data you want from the social media platform in question. What Are the Benefits of Social Media Data Mining for Your Business? Digging data from social media has almost endless benefits for your business. Today, many companies and/or organizations wonder what their users and customers think about them. These considerations are of greater importance than one might think. Many businesses conduct sentiment analysis while conducting market research and determine their marketing strategies based on these analyses. Sentiment analysis is one of the most important steps in marketing research. The best source for sentiment analysis is, of course, social media. Social media is a greater treasure for businesses than one might think. So much so that they can analyze both their current customers and potential customers. Moreover, these analyzes will be completely organic. Because people can express their wishes, complaints, and thoughts much more comfortably on social media platforms than in real life. Moreover, these views can be supported by other people. Social media is almost the only place where people can freely express their inner world. Unlike real life, people’s opinions and ideas can be stored as data. It is certainly not limited to these. You can find out what a person might like, what they are willing to buy, how much they are willing to pay for a good or service, the opportunity cost of that person, and even their interests. The power and effects of social media are enormous. For example, your customers need to be able to express their preferences, comments, suggestions, and complaints much more easily, and to interact with them in return for these situations. The advantage of social media data scraping is that it analyzes all the data of your customers and presents them to you after extracting and structuring the parts that will be useful to you. If you manage to use this data presented to you correctly and effectively, your business will grow much faster. If you want to learn how you can use the data you scraped from social media more effectively, you can contact our expert staff. Today, the marketing departments of businesses do social media data scraping for more organic analysis, rather than sending surveys that will fall into the spam folder of customers’ e-mail accounts. This method provides businesses with the opportunity to save both time and effort, and in today’s digital age, businesses often use this method. You can do research in your sector, be aware of the movements of the competitors in the sector, and analyze their price policies and marketing strategies, through the social media data scraping method. In addition to all these, timing is very important for any business. When you have to make time-sensitive decisions, you already know that the impact of those decisions will likely be huge. Social media data scraping will save your business a lot of time and effort as it will automate the data collection process. Scraper programs usually thoroughly scan all social media platforms for the search word. This scan can cover almost anything within social media platforms, from usernames to responses to comments. Since doing such a research process manually will be a process that requires a lot of effort and at least that much time, it will of course be more beneficial and much more economical in terms of your opportunity cost to do the process automatically rather than manually. In addition, you can collect data manually but in limited quantities. For example, maybe you can collect the data of 1000 people by working very hard, but you probably won’t be able to collect the data of 1000000 people manually by yourself. Therefore, automatic methods are preferred more often and are considered more useful. But let there be no misunderstanding here. The fact that data scraping from social media will be automatic does not mean that it will be unsafe. You can achieve more specific results by using an advanced scraping program and applying various filters. Potential Customer Audiences at a Lower Cost With social media data scrapers, you can reach your targeted customer group more conveniently and faster. This technological method that you will use for this will enable you to handle your business much faster and more reliable compared to traditional methods. If you have enough technical knowledge for this, you can create a web scraper program that can do a deep analysis. If you are new to the industry, you can access the data of competing companies in the industry and examine them, and you can review your own strategies in the light of this data, and then you can get new ideas. An Improvement: Public Relations Department Because the method of scraping data from social media is a very quick and simple process, it is a tool that can reduce the difficulties faced by the PR department. In addition, today, some businesses sometimes have problems or disagreements with their customers for several reasons. In such cases, they can use the data they dig from social media to find a solution rather than trying to resolve the conflict. This method increases customer satisfaction in general. A Great Helper: Follow Market Trends Changes in the market will affect the expectations of your current customers for your product or service. The most important thing for businesses to do in this situation is to analyze market trends well and determine customer preferences. For this, current market data is needed. Almost any social media platform on the web is a great place to learn about what competitors in the industry are doing and even how they are performing. In some cases, feedback on a service or product that you do not even suspect is successful can give you better and more reliable ideas. Because we humans sometimes can’t take everything into account. In such cases, social media data scrapers provide businesses with structured data, allowing businesses to update their current strategies and understand market trends more clearly. Legality Problem with Social Media Data Scraping Here we need to open a small but equally important topic. It should be noted that scraping public data is a completely legal process. But you can’t scrape everything. Some copyrighted content and certain proprietary information are protected by law. If you intend to scrape this data, you should read the General Data Protection Regulation. An Example of Legality: Facebook Facebook, a well-known social media platform, has approximately 2.9 billion monthly active users. Data scraping through this social media platform is completely legal since 2022. However, as mentioned above, the unauthorized scraping of proprietary content and its sale to third parties for profit is strictly prohibited. The public data that can be scraped from this platform are Username, profile URL, profile photo URL, follower’s information, likes… To scrape data other than these, you must obtain permission from the other party and inform it. Otherwise, you will be deemed to have committed a crime and the other party may sue you. It is possible to structure data scraped through social media and use it to manipulate audiences. However, this is not ethical behavior. As the scrape.do team, we are always here for you with our expert staff and an average response time of 10 minutes!

{"url": "https://scrape.do/blog/how-to-check-if-a-website-allows-scraping/", "title": "How to Check if a Website Allows Scraping? | Scrape.do", "description": "In this article, we will teach you how to tell if sites allow data extraction. You can read the article in detail and share it with scraping enthusiasts!", "h1": "How to Check if a Website Allows Scraping?", "content": "In this article, we will teach you how to tell if sites allow data extraction. You can read the article in detail and share it with scraping enthusiasts! In general, it does not matter whether you use Python, Java, or another programming language for web scraping. You can always check if the website you want to extract data from is allowed to scrape by checking the “robot.txt” file. You can scrape any website you want as long as you scrape public data and not get data from private domains that may contain sensitive information. Proxy Benefits On the other hand, we highly recommend using Proxy services while web scraping. Getting help from a Proxy while extracting data can benefit you in many ways: Using a proxy allows you to scrape a website much more reliably. In addition, the probability of spiders or bots being banned or blocked is greatly reduced. Using a proxy allows you to make requests from a specific geographic area or device. This allows you to seamlessly see the content the website is displaying for a specific location or device. Using a proxy service allows you to make higher volume requests to the target website without getting banned or blocked. Using a proxy allows you to bypass extensive IP bans imposed by some websites. Using proxies allows you to have unlimited simultaneous sessions on the same or different websites. What is Actually Web Scraping? Web scraping is a term for various methods used to gather information over the internet. Generally, this is done with software that simulates human web surfing to gather certain bits of information from different websites. Those who use web scraping programs may want to collect certain data to sell to other users or use it for promotional purposes on a website. Can Web Scraping be Detected? Web scraping can be detected. HTTP uses a set of headers that describe which browser users are using. Therefore it is known that you are there. However, it cannot be said that many people care about this situation. On the other hand, if you cause the data extracted site to crash, you are very likely to be sued for a DDoS attack. However, as we can see from here, web scraping is legal, so it is not inconvenient to be detected. If you just send too many requests and crash the server, you may be deemed to have launched an intentional virtual attack, according to the legal laws of some countries. However, you can neglect the terms of service of the sites. And really, lying won’t do you any good in this situation. Web Scraping Rules As long as you consider yourself a “guest” on the site you are extracting data from, you probably won’t do anything harmful, let’s examine the rules: ‍ Whatever you do, do not damage the website. This means that the volume and frequency of queries you make should not load the website’s servers or interfere with the website’s normal operations. You can do this in several ways: Limit the number of simultaneous requests from a single IP to the same website. Respect the delay that crawlers must wait between requests by obeying the crawl delays specified in the robots.txt file. If possible, schedule your crawls to occur during off-peak hours of the website. Do not violate copyright When scraping a website, you should ALWAYS check if the data on that site is copyrighted. Copyright is defined as the exclusive legal right over a physical work, such as an article, image, or film. Basically, if you own the copyright on a work, you own it. Common types of material that can be copyrighted on the web include: Article Videos Pictures Music Databases As a result, most of the data on the Internet is copyrighted works, so copyright scraping is very relevant and needs attention. Do not violate GDPR The introduction of GDPR has completely changed how you can scrape personal data, especially of EU citizens. On the other hand, personal data may contain highly sensitive information, which is any data that can identify a person. They are as follows: Name Email Phone number Address User name IP address Bank or credit card information Medical data Biometric data Unless you have a legal reason to collect and store this data and any of the data received belongs to an EU citizen, you are in violation of the GDPR. Run far far away in such a situation, because you violated the person’s consent! Consent If you are going to have a legal reason to collect a person’s data, that person must first have their consent to have their data scraped. Because you need to have “explicit consent” to scrape, store and use that person’s data the way you want. Legitimate interest If you are going to scrape data, it will be very difficult to prove that you have a legitimate interest in scraping someone’s personal data if you are doing it under a company name. In most cases, only the authorities tasked with maintaining security, such as governments, law enforcement, etc., have a legitimate interest in extracting the personal data of their citizens, as they will often scrape people’s personal data for the public interest. Is Web Scraping Legal? As we mentioned above, GDPR and other personal data laws of different countries are quite strict when it comes to collecting and storing personal data. Therefore, data scrapers need to either obtain their explicit consent or prove a legitimate interest in any personal data belonging to EU citizens, even if that data is publicly available, and they aim to minimize the amount of data collected. On the other hand, web scraping is a completely legal process. You just need to know what you are doing. Pay attention to sensitive areas such as personal data, with your explicit consent, do not crash the site! That’s all really.

Let's start exploring and updating our knowledge on web scraping to grow your business!", "h1": "10 Most Popular Myths & Facts About Web Scraping", "content": "In that article, we are going to see the most popular myths about web scraping and the real truths behind them. Let’s start exploring and updating our knowledge on web scraping. In the digital era, where information is the most important resource, the importance of web scraping is becoming increasingly clear. Web scraping is the technology of extracting a lot of web data from a site in a structured form, such as product fees, user information, product reviews, and much more. Many companies are realizing the benefits big data can bring to them and are tapping into the potential of web scraping. Subsequently, as a result, there has been a huge increase in demand for many web scraping techniques and applications over the past years. However, along with the increasing popularity of web scraping, the known truths and misconceptions about web scraping have also started to multiply at the same rate. We have discussed some of these myths for you. Have joyful reading! Some Myths that are Generally Wrong Let’s examine them: Web scraping is illegal (Is it?), Any website or data can be scraped, You need to know how to code, Web scraping and web crawling are basically the same things, Scraping can be used to collect emails, Web scraping is fully automated, Scraped data are only beneficial for business, A web scraper is versatile, You can scrape fast, API and web scraping are the same things. Web Scraping is Illegal The reason why such a myth about web scraping exists is that there are people who use web scraping for malicious purposes. Most people do not know if data scraping is legal or not, and companies that probably have millions of data in their databases invent such a myth to intimidate their competitors. Anyways, web scraping is a completely valid, useful, and powerful technology, and it’s legal. There is no problem when used with good intentions. However, in a digital world with thousands of scrapers violating intellectual property rights and stealing content, web scraping has its whites and blacks, of course. Naturally, issues and questions arise regarding the legality of web scraping depending on how people choose to use the data they obtain. Every website has a list of rules and Terms of Service that should be followed during scraping that scrapers should know ahead of time. Of course, malicious people will run into problems when they ignore their website’s terms of service and scrape without the site owner’s permission. In addition to the legal dimension of the business, the ethical dimension should also be taken into consideration. For example, if you improperly scrape non-public data and then publish it on a public platform, you will run into legal problems, no matter how good your intentions or is beneficial to the public interest. Any Website or Data Can be Scraped Naturally, the web is not a transparent space where we can do whatever we want. Therefore, besides the legal and ethical aspects of web scraping, many different obstacles may come your way. If a website does not allow scraping, no matter how much time and money you spend scraping that data, you will not be able to do anything with that data and it will be a futile effort. ‍ In some cases, some websites even create scraping barriers for publicly available information. Extracting and collecting data from such sites really requires expertise, knowledge, stability, effort, and money. Our myth is that people can crawl any site on the web. However, this is not the case. Every website is unique in site structure and design, so you cannot expect a scraper that works on one site to work on another. Many companies want to scrape Facebook users’ data such as email addresses, posts, or LinkedIn information. Here are the rules to know about it: “Private and sensitive information” containing username and password cannot be scrapped. You must abide by the Terms of Service. Copying copyrighted data is not allowed. However, that does not mean you cannot scrape any social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. You can scrape these sites as long as you abide by the rules in the Robots.txt files of the sites and do not violate any rights. However, in order to scrape Facebook, you must first obtain written permission. You Need to Know How to Code We know that knowing coding looks very tempting and cool. People who are proficient in coding may also want other people not to do what they can do themselves because they know we know it! However, that is not the case. Today, there are countless tools and services you can use for internet web scraping and data extraction. You do not have to be a programmer to scrape a website. Just keep in mind that not every program will work for every site. Try to browse services that provide quality data designed for your specific needs. Web Scraping and Web Crawling are Basically the Same Things Most people use the terms web scraping and web crawling interchangeably. I am warning you, do not make this mistake! The basic understandings of web scraping and web crawling, the technologies and processes they use are very different. Data scraping, as we know it, is an automated way of getting certain data from websites through tools or services. On the other hand, web crawling uses bots or crawlers to index general website data. Search engines like Google and Bing use crawling bots to extract general data shown in search results. Google crawls and indexes your websites via these bots. In other words, once your site is crawled and indexed, it is more likely to appear in the SERPs. Web scraping has no SERP-related concerns. Explore the differences between web scraping and web crawling ! Scraping Can be Used to Collect Emails One of the most common myths we come across is that web scraping can be used to collect email addresses for lead generation. Yes, we agree that this is true in theory, but in practice, it will disappoint you. Using web scraping to collect personal information is not considered ethical behavior anyway. Therefore, any public email list you scrape most likely will not be useful for your marketing purposes. Both these e-mails are mostly inactive and even if they are active, the owner of the account does not tolerate seeing a new e-mail because they receive dozens of marketing e-mails during the day, and you reach people who are not interested in your products and services. It is not worth the effort. Web Scraping is Fully Automated It is true that web scraping is fully automated, but human intervention will be required if any problems are encountered. Experts need to regularly monitor target websites so that they can easily spot structural changes and make necessary corrections. Scraped Data are Only Beneficial for Business Realizing that up-to-date and quality data is the main power, businesses and e-commerce sites use web scraping technology to both reach more information about the market and get to know their target audiences closely, narrow their competitors’ market share, and open up space for themselves. However, this does not mean that web scraping is only beneficial for businesses. Thinking that web scraping only helps businesses grow and commercial interests devalues ​​scraping technology. In industries like education, journalism, and finance, web scraping is an integral part of the research process. Researchers and students can focus on their own analysis and problem solving by obtaining accurate information from primary sources rather than worrying about sources of information. Similarly, data scraping helps journalists gather up-to-date and reliable information on current events locally and globally while facilitating fresh data on topics such as the stock market, investment, cryptocurrency, and finance. A Web Scraper is Versatile Websites may change their site structure and settings from time to time. If your scraper cannot scrape the same site a second time, stay calm, it does not necessarily mean that the relevant website is detecting you as suspicious. This may be due to different geographic locations or machine access. In such cases, you may need to make adjustments in advance. You Can Scrape Fast These are myths that can often be deceptive and harmful. You may have come across scraper ads that tell you how fast their browser is. Being able to collect data in seconds sounds tempting indeed, does not it? However, if this causes harm, you will be prosecuted, not the scraper providers. This is because a highly scalable data request overloads a web server, which can cause the server crash problem we mentioned above. In such a case, you are likely to be prosecuted under the “trespass to chattels” law. API and Web Scraping are the Same Things The API is for sending your data request to a web server and getting the requested data. API returns data in JSON format over HTTP protocol. However, that does not mean you can get any data you want. Therefore, they are not the same as web scraping. ‍"},

Let’s have a look at them together and start scraping web pages more effectively! You have met with the information, and know that it is the real power, right? Let’s say you are using an app and you need to feed the app with the data. But where is this data come from? You are scraping data from various websites. And, that is what web scraping is. At first, you may scrape data from a number of websites, let’s say 30, but when the time goes on the number of websites that you scrape data will increase in accordance with your needs, too. Well, it might not be that easy to scrape data from nearly 700 or 800 websites. It is time to scale up the process! However, scaling up the process can be bothering sometimes. You may encounter lots of problems in this process, and they are even not the same as what you encountered at first! No worries, we are here to tell you the 9 web scraping challenges you should know. It is inevitable to have some troubles when it comes to scaling up the business. Think web scraping at a large scale as a business, there could be lots of obstacles that roadblock the growth. When it comes to scraping data at a large scale bots’ blocking mechanisms might become a part of the activity. Before we begin, let’s see main things to check before starting web scraping ! Let’s examine the 9 challenges: Data Warehousing and Data Management It is not a secret that large-scale web scraping produces a massive amount of data. Let’s continue, if you are part of a crowd team, many of your colleagues will be working on the data. Of course, this does not point to an issue. However, that is a factor that might create a problem that companies generally overlooked. You need to build a proper and problem-free Data Warehousing infrastructure. Otherwise, you may face problems such as querying, searching, filtering, and exporting data at a time when the web scraping process has reached a large scale. In addition to these, the Data Warehousing infrastructure has to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure to maintain data scraping and extraction in the most perfect way. Website Structure Website owners want to attract visitors’ attention and improve their user experiences. That’s why they need to improve their digital experience, and in order to provide this, they periodically upgrade their User Interface. ‍ In web scraping, you are scraping the data from the HTML code, and that is also where the changes are. Moreover, websites consist of HTML and JavaScript codes elements, and when changes happened scrapers require changes, too. That’s why scrapers need adjustments for a period of time cause even a minor change in the website affects the quality of data. Anti-Scraping Technologies Some websites use powerful technologies that block web scraping attempts. LinkedIn, which we are all familiar with, is a good example. Such websites use different algorithms and encodings to disallow bot access and implement IP blocking mechanisms, even if it does not cause problems for legitimate web scraping practices. ‍\nOf course, there is a solution to this problem, but you may have to spend a lot of time and money to produce a technical solution. Many companies develop and use software that mimics human behavior to fool anti-scraping technologies. IP Based Blocking An IP address is your identity on the internet. In other words, we can say that an IP address is a special address assigned to a device. For example, big websites like Amazon can block your IP network. You know that there are thousands of products on Amazon, and let’s say the price data of these products are important to you. Let’s say you create a simple web scraper to scrape product prices. In the first scraping you will get few results, but then the scraper will fail. This is because Amazon blocks your network’s IP. Many websites can block web scrapers’ IP addresses if the number of requests from an IP is above a threshold. But this problem usually has an easy solution. You can avoid this problem by using a reliable proxy service that works at scale. CAPTCHA Based Blocking CAPTCHA is one of the toughest anti-scrap apps you can come across. It does not approve the pass like a security guard! Many e-commerce companies that do business online use CAPTCHA to identify non-human bot behavior on their website and naturally disallow scraping. It is very likely that you will encounter CAPTCHA at some point. While CAPTCHA solvers can help solve this problem, they will still reduce your scraping speed. Hostile Environment Some client-side technologies such as Ajax and Javascript are used to load dynamic content. Dynamic content creation, on the other hand, is something that makes web scraping difficult. As a result, scraping such websites is complicated. Honeypot Traps Some web designers place honeypot traps inside their websites to detect and trap web scrapers or bots. These traps are links that normal users cannot see and that a bot can. Just as a bee sees honey when it flies to a flower, and we humans only see a beautiful flower. The scraper must be capable of handling honeypot traps and must be carefully designed. Quality of Data You need to make sure that the data meets the quality guidelines because web scraping must be performed in real-time. Therefore, continuous monitoring is critical. In addition, the quality assurance system needs to be kept up to date and checked for new cases. A quality control system alone is not enough to keep the verified data of good quality. Instead, you need a solid AI layer. Legal Risks One of the potential risks of large-scale scraping is that it is illegal. Scraping means more requests per second. This could also be misinterpreted as a DDoS attack in a courtroom. There is no legal limit to the rate of web scraping in the US, but if the scraping overloads the server, the person responsible for the damage may be prosecuted under the “trespass to chattels” law. In Europe, however, the legal issue you have to worry about is GDPR from here. GDPR is software that prevents companies from using personally identifiable information. However, in a large-scale and detailed scraping process, any personal information is likely to leak."},

Almost the most important thing for a journalist is to get the most up-to-date and accurate information. While there are many ways to get up-to-date and accurate information, not all of them are that secure. One of the most popular methods of accessing accurate and up-to-date information in today’s digital world is web scraping. If used correctly, web scraping is a great information gathering tool to gather needed information at the fastest, most efficient, and lowest cost possible. In this article, we will talk about 4 different ways to use web scraping that journalist can use to improve their content. The scrape.do team is here for you! We guarantee the satisfaction of our valued users with our expert staff in the field! We strive to provide you with 24/7 service with an average response time of 10 minutes. For detailed information, you can review our website and contact our expert staff through our communication channels. Let’s start our article now! What is Web Scraping? Web scraping is one of the most indispensable data collection methods in today’s world. The scraping of data on one or more websites is done legally through various programs, software, or extensions. The purpose of scraping the data may vary. Some of these are price monitoring, sentiment analysis, and market research. The scraped data is extracted and structured according to its purpose. Web scraping is one of the most frequently preferred data collection methods in today’s digital world. Concept Needed to Know: Data Journalism Before we talk about these 4 methods, let’s talk about “data journalism”, which is an important concept that we need to know. What we call data journalism involves interpreting information inside large datasets that have been dug up. Therefore, it is a discipline that requires the journalist to know what the data in question means in real life and to convey this to his readers. Data journalists must have the ability to compile and make sense of large amounts of data, be able to describe the collected data with graphs, tables, pictures, and words, and report their findings. Before we came to the present day, data journalists would sacrifice weeks and maybe even months to compile statistics and information one by one from disparate sources. Today, they can perform these operations automatically in a few hours, maybe even minutes, by means of technological facilities such as web scraping. First Method: Scraping Datasets The reliability of the data they collect and will collect is of the utmost importance for journalists. As we mentioned, collecting data manually can be time-consuming and costly in some cases. In such cases, you can collect the data that you will obtain with web scraping, that is, you will scrape, much faster and cost-effectively. You can use web scraping in several different ways to collect datasets. One of them is scraping data from government websites. The data on such a website hosts datasets that are too large to be sorted manually. Another way is to scrape scientific articles from academic journals, which are used to develop studies specifically on specialized fields. As we constantly emphasize, the most important thing for a journalist is up-to-date and accurate information, and academic articles are great sources of such information. Method Two: Scraping Press Releases Press releases, which are one of the great sources of information for journalists, contain a lot of data about the story that a journalist is researching, from sources, contact information, and even the background information of that story. This process takes a lot less time than thought thanks to web scraping technology because it sorts press releases automatically rather than manually. This automatic sorting process we’re talking about should not be taken lightly because it saves an incredible amount of time. One of the ways to use web scraping to collect data from press releases is to use a web scraper that aggregates all the press releases from a website and saves the combined press releases into some kind of database. If you have enough technical knowledge, you can create such a web scraper yourself, if you do not have enough technical knowledge, you can either use an existing web scraper or get support from a programmer who can create a web scraper for you. If you have technical knowledge but not enough for such a scraper or if you are avoiding creating such a scraper, there is another way. You can try to create and set up a scraper that collects data from press releases via specified keywords. Especially if you are doing research on a particular subject, this method will be ideal for you. Method Three: News Sites with Great Sources of Information One of the enormous sources of information and data for journalists is news sites on the web. News sites usually share news on many topics actively 24/7. You can quickly access breaking news, background information, and details about the subject you are researching, and collect the data you need from such sites. Just like press release websites, the process of ranking news sites with web scraping is automatic and saves more time than you might think. One of the ways to scrape data for your research from news sites is to create a scraper or install an existing scraper that, as we mentioned earlier, collects all the headlines on a website and records the data it has collected into some kind of database. Another way is a scraper that scrapes data based on keywords, as we mentioned earlier. This method is the method that will be more beneficial for you, especially if you are researching news about a certain subject in a certain field. The Last and Hard Method: Creating Your Own Data Sometimes things don’t go that easy for journalists. So much so that under some conditions, they may not be able to find the data they need on the internet. When such situations are encountered, sometimes journalists may need to create their own data. One of the ways you can generate your own data like a journalist is, of course, again web scraping. However, it will not be as simple as the other three methods I have mentioned before. But although it is not simple, it is a method that will most likely help your business. One of the ways to use data scraping so journalists can generate their own data would be to scrape product websites. Especially if you are doing research where you will need data from certain sectors, then web scraping will come to your rescue. Another, and perhaps the most effective way, is to scrape social media websites, as you can imagine. Naturally, social media sites are the place where you can scrape a lot of data, from sentiment analysis to current news, in the most comfortable but also the most difficult place. People tend to be more comfortable on social media than they normally are, and they can openly express their opinions and views. This inevitably makes social media sites a very comprehensive data source. After legally scraping the data you need from the web, there is another very important thing to do, and that is to structure the data you have collected. Unstructured data doesn’t mean much on its own. As defined above, data journalism does not directly present the excavated data to its readers, it extracts, structures interpret, and transfers that data. That is, it does not present the data naked to its readers because it is meaningless to the readers. Scrape.do, which has been experienced in the sector for a long time, is waiting to serve you, our valuable users, with its expert team! Moreover, thanks to the geo-targeting feature, you can target any country you need before you even start browsing the Web, and you will be where you want to be.

Web scraping is often used for data analytics and data science, marketing and sales, competition and competitor research, Search Engine Optimization auditing and keyword research, following the development of your brand, portfolio and hedge fund management based on data, and product and website strategies. Data Science with Web Scraping You can benefit from web scraping when you develop an artificial intelligence application and when you need this artificial intelligence application to improve itself. In order to improve the output of artificial intelligence applications, large amounts of data and information with as high accuracy as possible are needed. By using web scraping, you can have as accurate information as possible in the areas your artificial intelligence application needs, and you can provide machine learning training in the shortest way by uploading this information to your artificial intelligence application. You’ll waste a lot of time trying to collect data one by one and categorize it based on accuracy, so using web scraping is one of the best moves you can make. Marketing and Sales with Web Scraping By using the Web Scraping method, you can collect the prices of a product in the category you want or products similar to your product, collect and analyze the data of your products or products, and protect your brand’s reputation. Price Evaluation The prices of the products on the websites may vary depending on the region or the website where the products are located. For example, you can buy a pot from the USA much cheaper than in China, or you can find a cheaper product on any website. If you are a wholesale business, it will take a long time for you to examine all the websites. You can use web scraping to get the products you want at a cheaper price and to research the prices of your competitors. Analysis of Product Data If the same product is on different websites and there is a serious difference between the sales of the products on these websites, the reason for this should be investigated. For example, a sneaker you sell may have lower sales, while the same sneaker sold by a competitor may be sold more. By researching the difference between websites with web scraping, you can increase your sales and make your product descriptions more attractive. Brand Protection Many sellers on the internet sites may imitate your products or use your name to offer products that are not of your quality. Such situations should be corrected as soon as possible, as they can negatively affect the quality, perspective, and popularity of your brand. By using web scraping to detect these situations, you can quickly identify problems before they grow and take legal action when necessary. We can also tabulate the problems you may encounter with your brand and notice with web scraping as follows: Counterfeiting Your products may be offered for sale by counterfeit stores or by other stores by making your products forged. However, if you use web scraping, you can identify these products before other users buy them and protect your brand. Copyright infringement It is a crime if any of your copyrighted works are reposted on the internet without your express consent. By using web scraping, you can quickly spot crimes and take legal action. Trademark infringement If your brand’s logo, pattern, expressions, or something special and popular with your brand is used without your permission, you can find out with web scraping and sue those people. Competition and Competitor Research with Web Scraping Using the web scraping method, you can generate leads, set the priority of your leads for purchasing, and review your consumers’ comments about your products. Lead Generation Of course, you want your business to have more customers and increase the sales of the products in your business, but do you know what you need to do for this? If you want to reach additional customers, you need people who have never bought from you before and who are interested in the products in your area. You need information such as e-mail, phone, and social media accounts to identify and communicate with these people. You can save time and effort by using web scraping as it can be quite challenging to obtain this information one by one. Prioritizing Prospective Purchases In the method called Account-Based Marketing, you can easily obtain company graphics and technological data by using web scrapers. With the data you obtain, you can determine which behaviors your customers buy your products, and you can ensure that your company has higher sales by prioritizing. For example, if you see that your customers benefit more from a buy-one-free campaign, you can place this campaign first in the priority of your marketing strategies to increase your sales again. Reviewing Your Consumers’ Reviews Of course, it is pleasing to read the positive comments of your consumers about your products, while reading the negative comments is extremely disturbing. However, because negative reviews are annoying, if you avoid these reviews and ignore them, you will lose a large customer base. Therefore, you should identify the strengths and weaknesses of your products and strengthen the weaknesses of your products by obtaining all the positive and negative comments made by your customers about your products through web scraping and then examining them. Search Engine Optimization Audit and Keyword Research with Web Scraping If you have a website, whether your website is designed for e-commerce or not, Search Engine Optimization must be done correctly in order for your website to get more views and become popular. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Yandex consider many factors when limiting websites in search engine results pages, and your website must adapt to these factors in order to rank at the top. However, if you do not know how to do Search Engine Optimization of your website and you have sample websites that rank high on search engine results pages, it would be a logical decision to examine these websites with web scraping to find out what you are missing. Web Scraping Fields When performing a Search Engine Optimization audit using the web scraping method, you can also do these: You can detect technical SEO issues such as slow loading times, and broken links. While detecting these problems, you can examine the positive or negative feedback of your customers. You can set new backlinks. In this way, you can analyze whether incoming and outgoing connections are working correctly. You can scrape user traffic and rankings on search engine results pages of websites that sell similar products or publish similar content to yours. Through this scraping, you can find out what keywords other companies are using to gain popularity. By scraping the websites on the search engine results pages, you can have new strategic ideas by learning about the content and products that you do not own but on other websites, moreover, that attract attention. You can determine successful content strategies by scraping the structural features (such as using tables, word count, and title layout) of the content of popular websites that rank higher than you on search engine results pages. By determining the keywords that you use frequently and that your competitors also use, you can periodically check the rank of your website in terms of these keywords. With this check, you can be aware of changes in the popularity of your website. Tracking the Development of Your Brand or Website with Web Scraping If your brand is a developing brand on the internet or if your brand has its own website, you already know that your popularity will increase over the internet. Since we are in the age of technology, how else can you popularize your brand? If you want to follow step by step how your brand and website have become popular or how popular it has become, you can use the web scraping method. In addition to learning the rank of your website on the search engine results pages, you can easily learn which websites your brand is mentioned on, how it is mentioned, and whether you have a positive impression. We can show you social media accounts and posts and news sites as examples of areas where you can do web scraping so that you can more easily research the popularity of your brand or website. Portfolio and Hedge Fund Management Based on Data with Web Scraping The hedge fund, which is used to obtain faster and higher returns with minimal restrictions, is one of the mutual funds where you can follow your most flexible investment strategies. The most important difference that distinguishes these funds from mutual funds is that you can sell short and you can invest with borrowed resources. In addition, by using hedge funds, you can make short and long-term gains, apply arbitrage strategies, and buy and sell real estate at the same time. You need to leverage data to develop better investment strategies and improve your portfolio, and a hedge fund is one of the most critical funds to use data. By using the web scraping method, you can extract news articles for analysis and use these news and analysis articles to make the most accurate decisions. Product and Website Strategies with Web Scraping By using the web scraping method, you can create a product from scratch according to the wishes and needs of your customers, and you can do market research by analyzing how and how much competitors sell their products. Building a Product from Scratch for Customers Of course, you want to create a product that meets the wishes and needs of your customers, after all, both your customers and you will be satisfied with it. However, if you try to do this with manual research and marketing strategies, it will take a lot of time because you need data on a large scale. By using web scraping for this, you can get the data quickly and get the products you want. Conducting Market Research by Analyzing Competitors Just as a professor needs data when doing academic research, a marketer needs data when researching and analyzing other companies. Since research cannot be done without data, web scraping can be used to analyze competitors and learn about their marketing strategies. When you use web scraping, you save time and have an objective point of view as you can access the positive and negative comments of competing companies or websites at the same time. In this way, you can market your products better. If you want to do web scraping for data science, marketing and sales, competition and competitor research, SEO optimization, brand development tracking, data-driven portfolio management, and product and website strategies, you are at the right place!

But what happens when our emotions enter the economy, how do our emotions affect companies? In fact, this is a question that companies that want to develop are also curious about. However, they use sentiment analysis to explore our emotions and offer services and products that meet our wishes. As the Scrape.do team, in this article, we told you what sentiment analysis is, the types of sentiment analysis, how sentiment analysis works, and the places where sentiment analysis can be used. The first thing you need to do in order to be able to do sentiment analysis and improve your business by understanding the sentiment analysis of your customers is to read this article and the second thing is to contact us! Moreover, we help you with anything that comes to your mind. What Does Sentiment Analysis Mean? Sentiment analysis, in which many techniques such as natural language processing and computational linguistics are used, is a type of analysis that companies perform in order to understand the feelings and wishes of customers as a result of the collection and classification of texts on the internet. With this analysis method, it is easier to determine which brands or products consumers react to and how they react compared to natural ways. In this analysis method, human expressions are classified in three main ways and these shapes are positive, negative, and neutral. You can easily see this method on Google or Amazon, which a customer uses to understand whether a customer’s reaction to any product is positive or negative. The stars you see when buying a product on Amazon and looking at a restaurant on Google are an example of sentiment analysis. What are the Types of Sentiment Analysis? We mentioned that sentiment analysis focuses on the polarity of a product or service evaluation, these poles are positive, negative, and neutral. However, some sentiment analysis types can also have attributes such as angry, happy, sad, or urgent, not urgent. The type of sentiment analysis that a store should choose varies depending on how the customer wants to evaluate their feedback and queries. In this section, we touched on the most popular types of sentiment analysis, namely graded sentiment analysis, sentiment detection, aspect sentiment analysis, and multilingual sentiment analysis. Graded Sentiment Analysis In the graded sentiment analysis method, which is ideal for businesses that want to evaluate more clearly and precisely, two extremes are determined and one of these extremes expresses the most negative while the other expresses the most positive. As an example, we can show a ranking in which 5 is very positive and 1 is very negative. You can also edit this rating as a star. Very positive - 5 Positive - 4 Natural - 3 Negative - 2 Very negative - 1 Sentiment Perception Sentiment perception analysis does not clearly have polarities compared to graded sentiment analysis, so it is not possible for a consumer to make very positive or very negative comments directly to you. Instead, this method involves emotions such as happiness, disappointment, anger, and sadness. Because customer feedback in this method can be quite difficult to understand, predetermined and integrated dictionaries or complex machine learning algorithms are often used. There is a serious disadvantage in the sentiment perception analysis method. In this method, when a dictionary is used, people’s feelings are accepted within certain patterns. Some people may express their feelings aggressively. For example, when a person writes the comment “I wanted this dress badly since summer”, the sentence may be perceived as negative because of the word “badly” in this sentence, but the evaluation is extremely positive. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis The aspect-based sentiment analysis method is used additionally for specific situations, you cannot use this method alone like graded sentiment analysis. The most important reason for this is that this method is for you to understand which aspects of a product people are satisfied with and which aspects are negative. So, if you’re selling a shoe, you might want to know if customers find the shoe size large or small, that’s what this method is for. In addition, we can say that there are two opposite poles in this method, such as very positive and very negative. For example, short-long, wide-narrow, and small-large. Multilingual Sentiment Analysis The multilingual sentiment analysis method is the most difficult method among sentiment analysis methods. This method is not generally preferred by amateurs as it involves a lot of preprocessing and adding resources. In order to perform multilingual sentiment analysis, resources, some of which are available online and some that need to be created from scratch, must be added to the algorithm. In order to perform these algorithm operations, you must have at least an average level of coding and programming knowledge. How Do Sentiment Analysis Algorithms Work? In the sentiment analysis method, which can also be called opinion mining, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms are used to automatically analyze online reviews and comments. Which algorithm you should use depends on how much data you need to analyze and how accurate you want your model to be. Before we go into these algorithms in detail, we have prepared a table for you to review: Sentiment Analysis Algorithm Brief Description Rule-based Sentiment Analysis Algorithms In these algorithms, a set of manually created rules are used to automatically perform the sentiment analysis desired. Automated Sentiment Analysis Algorithms Data learning technique is used to perform sentiment analysis and mainly rely on machine learning techniques. Hybrid Sentiment Analysis Algorithms Both the rule-based approach and the automated approach are utilized. 1. Rule-based Sentiment Analysis Algorithms In sentiment analysis algorithms that work on a rule-based basis, a set of rules made by people can be added to the algorithm to help determine whether an evaluation is positive or negative. These rules added to the algorithm can be from various NLP techniques, examples of these techniques are stemming, tokenization, speech fragment tagging and parsing, and dictionaries. In rule-based sentiment analysis algorithms, it doesn’t matter in which order the words are combined, only whether the word is used and whether it is positive or negative. Since the rules in these algorithms are set by human hands, of course, more advanced techniques can be used and new rules can be included in the algorithm, but each time a new rule is added, the previous rules may be affected and the system may become complex from the beginning. Also, rule-based sentiment analysis algorithms need constant fine-tuning and maintenance, so these algorithms cannot be one-off and require regular payments. Here is an example of how the rule-based sentiment analysis algorithm works: As a first step, you define a list of words. This list of words should consist of dictionaries that will be evaluated as bad, such as bad, worst, ugly, awful, and disgusting, and words that will be evaluated as good, such as great, very good, best, good, and excellent. If the number of positive words in a comment is more than negative words, the system perceives this comment as positive and forwards it to you. However, if there are too many negative words, the comment is considered negative. If positive words and negative words are equal, they are considered neutral. 2. Automatic Sentiment Analysis Algorithms In automatic sentiment analysis algorithms, unlike rule-based sentiment analysis algorithms, you do not need to add any rules. All operations in these algorithms are based on machine learning. The analysis task of this algorithm is set as a classification problem, then a classifier text is added and this classifier text is evaluated as positive, negative, and neutral. Training Process: The algorithm has thoroughly learned the test examples that have been used before in the training process and tries to learn to associate the information it has learned with the text entered into it with the label. This algorithm, which is described as a feature extractor, transfers the text to the feature vector, allowing the text to be evaluated as positive, negative, or neutral. ‍ Prediction Process: In this process, the feature extractor transforms the text into feature vectors and feeds these feature vectors into the model that generates the predicted labels. ‍ Classification Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning are generally used as classification algorithms. ‍ Naive Bayes Bayes Theorem is used for the category of the text used as input. ‍ Linear Regression Used to predict some values ​​whose properties are determined by a set, this algorithm is very often used in statistics. Support Vector Machines Treats text instances as representative points in a multidimensional space and is not a probabilistic model. Deep Learning Artificial neural networks are used to process data, in this method a series of algorithms is used and this series tries to learn something by imitating the human brain. 3. Hybrid Sentiment Analysis Algorithms In hybrid sentiment analysis algorithms, the desired features of rule-based and automatic sentiment analysis algorithms are combined and used as a single algorithm. The most important reason for using these systems is that the results are more accurate than other algorithms. The Most Common Uses of Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis can be used for different purposes in many areas. We can list the most frequently used areas where sentiment analysis can be used as follows: Brand Monitoring: If a customer is leaving a review and it’s a negative review, the customer is doing it to get their voice heard, and sentiment analysis works just fine. If companies have launched a new product or launched a new campaign, they can improve themselves by examining the comments of their customers. Monitoring Employee Feedback: Employee feedback may seem meaningless to a company executive, but employee feedback can help a company grow or shrink. With sentiment analysis, organizations can analyze employee emotions and better interpret these analyzes by segmenting them. In addition, when regulations are made taking into account the opinions of the employees, the efficiency of the employees will increase, and this will benefit the company. Product Analysis: By performing sentiment analysis, it is easier for organizations to understand which products are sold out quickly, and which products can be improved by taking into account the negative comments made by customers about a specific product. In addition, more sales can be achieved by emphasizing the good aspects of the products. Improving Customer Support: According to a recent study, more than a quarter of customers stop using that company’s products completely after a single bad customer support experience. Considering that customer support is of such great importance, organizations need to improve their customer service team with sentiment analysis. It will be sufficient to examine social media platforms, blogs, and forums to detect this. If there is a negative opinion, many users will have already given advice. By using our scraper service that we have offered to you as Scrape.do, you can maintain your sales competitively, examine how your products are reflected on social media, improve your customer support, make product analysis, and provide crisis management and monitor your brand.

We guarantee customer satisfaction with our expert staff! Do not forget to review our website for detailed information. Web scraping and API methods are extremely useful and popular methods that companies use to extract data today. As a result of both methods, data is obtained. Companies can use this obtained data both to compete with their competitors and to maintain their existence. As Scrape. do, we have discussed both web scraping and API methods in this article for our valued users. We guarantee customer satisfaction with our expert staff! Do not forget to review our website for detailed information. What We Need to Know First: What Is Web Scraping and API? Before we talk about which one is better and more useful in which areas, it would be useful to define and distinguish these concepts from each other. Let’s first say what is web scraping and define this concept. Web Scraping Web scraping is the name given to the process of extracting data from one or more websites for specific purposes. Web scraping can be done for different purposes and in different formats. Fast, reliable data extraction can be done in direct proportion to the technical knowledge of the person performing the scraping process. The extracted data is generally used by companies for purposes such as obtaining information about the customer base, conducting market research, following up on financing and investment businesses, and keeping the value of the company growing and maintaining its value. Web scraping is a completely legal process. Today, it has become a method that almost every company that tries to keep up with the times uses and then benefits from. Learn More Learn what you can get by benefitting from web scraping. In this article, we will tell you what web scraping is, what it takes to do web scraping, how web scrapers work, what types of web scrapers are, why you should use web scraping, how websites are … ‍ We have tried to make the definition of web scraping as concise as possible above. Now let’s define our other concept, the API. API The concept of API, which is the full version of “Application Programming Interface), is still very important, even if we do not come across it until web scraping. Basically, we can say that it is a set of communication protocols that allow access to the data of an operating system, an application, or different services. In general, the API is made to allow the development of different applications that use almost the same data. The API system was developed in the 1970s and began to be used more actively in the early 1990s. In general, we can say that an existing application presents functions and information that are not within its own body to the users through the API included in its compounds, from the application that is the source of the information and functions in question. E-commerce platforms, one of the most well-known examples today, need APIs for processes such as adding products, receiving orders and payments, e-invoices and accounting. ‍ Our First Comparison: How Do They Work? Programs in web scraping extract content such as images, videos, or text from a public website and store it in a data file format. For this situation, the analogy of taking a photo of a website and analyzing the different elements in the image is made. In addition, web scrapers can analyze multiple websites and scrape data simultaneously. Unlike the web scraping method, the API creates an automated data pipeline between the requester and the website, targeting a specific part of website content. Data can be pulled automatically or optionally manually. Both the receiver and the website take an active role in the API method. ‍ We Need More Details: Similarities and Differences Now that we’ve explored and understood what the concepts of web scraping and API are, let’s talk about the differences and similarities between them. Our biggest, most important similarity is this: no matter how different both web scraping and API work from the aforementioned methods, they provide the same service in providing data to users. However, these two processes are quite different from each other in terms of operation. We can start by explaining the differences simply by saying: There are two ways to get from point A to point B, which one you choose is up to you and your situation. The web scraping method is the process of extracting data from one or more websites manually or via software tools. In general, extracting data through programs is relatively more preferred as it is much more efficient and takes relatively less time than manually extracting data. The situation is slightly different for the API. With an Application Programming Interface, you can access the data of an application or operating system. Because of this, APIs are directly tied to the owner of the dataset in question. Depending on the preferences, this data can be presented to the user for a fee or free of charge, as far as the owner of the data set allows. The mentioned limitation here is one of the differences between API and web scraping, the disadvantages that the API method creates for its users. While the web scraping method provides a data extraction option via web scraping tools, the API method provides direct access to your desired data type and this is one of the advantages that APIs offer their users over the web scraping method. While you can access much more data for free with the web scraping method, access to this data may be limited or paid in the case of the API method, which offers web scraping users another plus. Data extraction through the API method is generally done only through a website. However, with the web scraping method, you can work on more than one website and this saves you time. In addition, the API allows you to obtain a specific dataset. Another plus of web scraping is the trust in proxy servers that are not available in APIs. Web scraping tools organize the scraped data in a structured format. On the other hand, the data obtained by the API method must be edited additionally. In this regard, the web scraping method is more advantageous for its users than the API method. An operation that is not possible in the API is possible with web scraping. This process is the automatic storage of data. In addition, it has a much more customizable, complex structure compared to the web scraping API. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. However, there are some things we can say in general. The web scraping method is newer and more user-friendly than the API method. It is not limited and paid like API.

Although both methods have different ways in themselves, it is useful to remind that they have advantages and disadvantages against each other according to the wishes of the user. But which method requires less technical effort? Let’s explain this issue. APIs generally require the user requesting the data to create a custom application for the data query. In contrast, there are many external tools for web scraping that require relatively less technical knowledge. For example, there are web scraping extensions that you can install on your browser. Let’s go into a little more detail. ‍ APIs require you to create custom code that specifies the data you need, including your access keys. Unlike this, building a web scraper completely from scratch is also an option, which also requires good technical knowledge. But compared to API, there are web scraping tools that allow you to scrape data from one/several websites without the need for your coding skills. There is a case where websites in general have basic structures that web scrapers can recognize. This is because websites need to be scraped to be indexed by search engines. An Important Point to Mention: Legality From a legal point of view, APIs are provided by the websites you need data from. Therefore, it is legal to pull data through the API as long as you follow the API guidelines. Web scraping is legal as long as the provisions specified in the “robot.txt” file of the website you intend to scrape data are followed. For the legality of the web scraping method, it is very important that you browse the relevant parts of the website you want to scrape data from. Preferred Method Today: API + Web Scraping Today, companies intend to move away from traditional methods and obtain their data much faster and more reliably. This is one of the greatest requirements of our time for companies to grow and maintain their value. Companies use the data extracted from their websites to compete with rival companies, maintain their existence and create customer bases. Web scraping is mostly the first used data acquisition method today. However, in some cases, if web scraping is not possible or sufficient data cannot be obtained by web scraping, the web scraping + API method can be used. If you want to obtain data on behalf of your company by using the right methods in the right places, we are here for you as a scrape.do with an average response time of 10 minutes!

Learn how to access accurate and reliable data while making informed decisions with scrape.do!", "h1": "What Is Data Quality? 3 Importance for Your Business", "content": "In today’s article we are going to look at how scraping data on web product quality can benefit your business optimization process. Let’s have a look at the details together. Data means everything to the people who are in the business. Most people are aware of the value and insights they might derive from data. Because, as you know, knowledge is the most valuable resource, and no one will give it to you without an exchange. However, data is precious if it is only derived from a good source. This means the data needs to be high-quality. Data that is devoid of high quality might cause a huge loss. In other words, it is clear that the data have to be quality, you must measure it well to help your business. Let’s see where to begin. What is Data Quality? There are many factors that improve data quality. Let’s see them together: Accuracy You don’t need to be an expert to understand the value of accurate data, actually. Most marketers defend that accuracy is one of the most important factors in purchasing decisions. Well, accuracy gives you the real-life conditions of your target customers. On the other hand, if you follow misleading data, that will create an issue. Because you don’t track the truth. When the actions your company made depend on false data, your expectations are not satisfied automatically. Think about a really easy example, let’s say you think your target customers are young women who are single, have no child, and continuing their degrees. However, you find out that your data is incorrect and indeed, your target customers are adult men who are in their fifties, divorced, and bald. In this scenario, your marketing campaigns will not satisfy the expectation. Completeness Your data need to be complete in order to serve you at its best. If your survey questions are not completed by your customers, you have gaps in the data. That could be the age of customers, their gender, their demographic conditions, their consuming behavior, or anything else that comes to mind. If your data is deficient, you might be getting in trouble with misleading results. Thus, your days and night that be spent on the corporate’s new ad campaigns might be ended up with nothing. Relevancy Yes, we know data is important. In fact, high-quality data is important. However, you need to be sure about the data that you have collected. Are they really relevant? Are they useful for your companies? Don’t try to access all the data that you don’t need, it will only consume your valuable time. You have to be sure if the data is relevant to the company’s goals. Validity This time the important thing is how the data is collected rather than the data itself. Your data is only valid if it’s in the right format, type, and range. Let’s say you want to measure users visiting time of your website, you need to decide which format you may use. Timeliness Timeliness is about the recentness of an event which is represented by data. Clearly, your data need to be recorded as soon as possible after the real-life event. Data tends to be being less useful and correct as time goes on. To avoid that problem, you need to make sure that the timeline between the event and the time that event is recorded via data are consistent. Outdated data might be harmful to the accuracy of the research. Likewise, the results are might ended up being inaccurate. Why Data Quality is Matters? As the technology is improved, data management techniques are also improved. In this way, businesses find themselves in the middle of a competitive environment. Many companies are aware of the value of data, and they use data to improve their marketing campaigns, products, finance, and so on. It can be said that companies that cannot catch the developments in terms of data are sentenced to fall behind. As you know, the more high-quality data, the more benefit you can derive from it. With the same logic, misleading and deficient data could harm your company. Integration of the data into the business’ operations might be influential on the marketing, sales, content. In this way, the data needs to be organized and maintained. How Does Measuring Data Quality Help Your Business? Data management is the building block of a company. If companies want to survive in this competitive market, they have to keep up with it and have to be aware of opportunities. High-quality data provides lots of benefits to businesses. Let’s see them together: Informed Decision-Making As your data accuracy is increased, your decision-making will be faster and more consistent, too. Improved data helps to decrease risks to businesses and provides consistent decisions. Better Audience Targeting As we talked about before, consistent and accurate data improve the examination of target audience quality. When you know the most important information about your target audience, your actions will be more correct. Effective Content and Marketing Campaigns When you know better about your target audience the quality of marketing campaigns will increase, too. In this way, you will be able to create more relevant contents that appeal to your audiences. Scraping Data You can scrape data from the web. Either automatically or on your own. Scraping is one of the easiest and most reliable ways to gain data. Web scraping is also known as data scraping, is the process of gaining info -or in our example, data- from websites. ‍In essence, scraping is the process of obtaining essential data, storing it, and, turning it into something that you can understand. Here, all you need to do is examine the data. Also, the error rate is close to zero. In this way, you will be able to reach the most accurate data. Explore Now: The History of Web Scraping ‍"},

Data visualization, used to understand a qualitative situation, provides an important toolkit for businesses to decide what to do next. With data visualization, you can explore the dataset in more detail and extract some information to create a dataset with the help of this method. Using the data visualization method, patterns, corrupted data, outliers and much more can be revealed. If you have domain knowledge of data visualization, you can use charts that can be of greater benefit to you and your business than attribution of important metrics. With these charts, you can express and indicate key relationships in your projects and jobs. As the Scrape.do team, in this article, we will tell you what data visualization is, the techniques of data visualization, and the importance, purpose, and benefits of data visualization in order to better understand your data. What is Data Visualization? In the data visualization technique, which can be defined as a graphical representation of information and data, visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps are used. With data visualization, trends, preferences, trends, outliers, and patterns in the data can be seen and understood more clearly. We have a lot of data these days, so data visualization tools have to be used. Thanks to data visualization tools and technologies, large amounts of data can be easily analyzed and data-based decisions can be made more easily. Since data visualization is often used to model complex events, weather models, medical conditions, and mathematical relationships are examples of areas where it is used. Top 10 Data Visualization Techniques Which data visualization technique you will use for the data you have depends on what your data will be used for and what type it will be. The 10 most popular data visualization techniques are pie charts, bar charts, histograms, Gantt charts, heat maps, box and whisker charts, waterfall charts, area charts, scatter charts, and pictogram charts. Let’s take a detailed look at these data visualization techniques. 1. Pie Chart Used in a wide variety of applications, pie charts are among the most common and basic data visualization techniques, and are ideal for ratio comparison or part-to-whole comparisons. Also, pie charts are easier to read than other charts, so they should be studied by people who are unfamiliar with the information and need important inferences. It is not possible to make a detailed analysis because there is not enough data in this chart type. 2. Bar Chart A bar chart, which can also be called a classic bar chart, is one of the easiest data visualization methods. In bar charts, on one axis of the graph, there are all the categories to be compared, and on the other axis, measured values ​​for these categories are found. The main disadvantage of bar charts is that labeling and clarity can be a big problem if there are too many categories included in the chart. However, you can use bar charts for more complex datasets. 3. Histogram Unlike bar charts, which show the distribution of data over a specified range or defined time, histograms help you identify where values ​​are concentrated. You can also detect gaps and unusual values​​in data using histograms. This data visualization technique is used specifically to show the frequency of a particular event, for example, if you want to see how many clicks a website gets each day for a month, you can use histograms. Using this visualization technique, you can identify the days when your website is the most and least popular, and quite quickly. 4. Gantt Chart You can make your project management more effective with Gantt charts that help you see the progress of the timeline and tasks in a project. In this data visualization technique, while the works to be done are found on the vertical axis, the time interval for those jobs is listed on the horizontal axis. By using Gantt charts to better manage time, you can deliver scheduled work faster and allow team members to better track projects. You can work on a regular basis by learning the Gantt charts that project management experts must know. 5. Heat Map In heat maps, which is a highly colorful data visualization technique with color variations, colors are used to show the differences in the data. Thanks to heatmaps, the trends of the audience can be understood more quickly and planning can be done easily. However, a person needs a clear indicator to be able to study and successfully read and interpret a heatmap. There are many possible applications of this data visualization technique, as heatmaps can be used to monitor any sales or activity. For example, if you want to know in which hour range your store sells the most, you can use a heat map that shows the hours on the horizontal axis and the days on the vertical axis, all you need to do to read the data more clearly is coloring. 6. Box and Whiskers Graph In the data visualization technique, which can be called box and whisker graph or simply box graph, a visual summary is provided by means of quadrants. To use this chart, a box is drawn from the first quarter to the third of the data set you have, and a line inside this box represents the median of the data. Using the lines, the minimum and maximum are reached, and all outliers are indicated by individual dots aligned with the lines. In this data visualization technique, it is easy to understand whether the data is symmetrical or skewed. The box and whisker plot also provides a visual summary of the data. 7. Waterfall Chart The waterfall chart is generally used when there is a value that is affected by factors such as time and changes in line with these factors. The main purpose of waterfall charts is to clearly show the person viewing the chart how a specified value rises or falls over time. That’s why waterfall charts are often used to show expenses or earnings over time. 8. Area Chart A different variation of the baseline chart, an area chart is intended to represent the total value of each data point, while the area under a line is shaded. Sometimes it is necessary to compare and examine several different data series on the same chart, in which case it is possible to use stacked area charts. Area charts show the changes in the quantity of one or more data over time, and this display is aimed to show how each data comes together to form a whole. part-to-whole comparisons can be shown more effectively in stacked area charts. 9. Scatter Chart Another widely used technique for visually displaying data, a scatter chart has points drawn against the horizontal and vertical axis, with these points representing two different variables. Thanks to this data visualization technique, the existing relationship between the variables is shown and the trends and correlations in the data are determined. It is easier to identify trends when there are more data points, so it makes the most sense to use scatter sets when fairly large data sets are available. 10. Pictogram Chart Pictogram charts present simple data in a more visual and engaging way. In this type of chart, symbols are used to visualize the data and each symbol represents a different value or category, making it very easy to understand the data. For example, if you want to represent how much a product sells with visuals, you can put an icon and write that this symbol represents 100 units. Since you do not need to know any language to understand pictogram graphics, you can avoid language and cultural differences with these graphics. Why is Data Visualization Important? Businesses can easily adapt to new trends thanks to data visualization, which helps businesses identify data trends easily and quickly that may pose a challenge. Data visualization is frequently used because the data is increasing day by day and it is very difficult to make sense of quintillion byte data. So much so that every professional company uses data visualization techniques to understand data, because any type of data can determine whether a business will get better or worse. Project planners can also use data visualization to more clearly describe their plans. Here’s why it’s important to use data visualization: You Can Analyze Data Better By analyzing the reports, you can ensure that the people with whom you share the same job focus on the areas that need attention. By using visual media, it becomes easier to understand the key points required for the jobs. You can access better analytics and better business decisions with data visualization, which you can use to prepare a sales report or create a marketing strategy. You Can Make Important Decisions More Quickly We can say that people understand visualized data better than boring tables or reports. If the data is understood more quickly, it will be possible for the decision-makers to make decisions based on the data more quickly, so that the business can grow more quickly. You Can Make Sense of Complex Data Easier New patterns and errors in data can be easily understood with data visualization techniques that can be used so that people working in a company can understand large amounts of data. By understanding these patterns, users can learn the must-haves and the things they say absolutely must not be, and the growth of the company can be achieved by removing the areas that hinder progress.

Any business must be able to make quick decisions if it wants to grow better and easier. There are measures to be taken on time, and if these measures are delayed, significant losses may be encountered. Businesses need a big explanation for significant differences in trends and patterns, thanks to this explanation businesses can survive and survive. After all, a company needs to understand why it is losing and learn how to prevent this loss. Thanks to data visualization, possible errors, and inaccuracies in the data are determined quickly and incorrect data does not cause any errors. Companies that use data visualization techniques to access real-time information and to be more successful in management have more profit. With this data visualization, decision-makers strive to increase the efficiency of operations and increase the productivity of the company and its employees. Visuals and storytelling can be used to accurately convey a message to customers and people viewing the charts. With data visualization, the right messages can be conveyed to people. ·We can say that people who want to achieve their business goals can use data visualization to learn which direction they need to go. Quick analysis can be done and critical metrics can be understood instantly, as visual representations and graphical representations make the data easier to understand. With data visualization techniques, the latest trends can be discovered quickly and other companies and businesses can be easily avoided. Without data visualization, businesses would need more time to customize their reports and modify their dashboards. Employees also had to work harder to respond to temporary requests. Therefore, we can say that data visualization saves time. Before using data visualization techniques, a detailed data collection process is required. When this is done manually, the data collection process can take a very long time. However, by using the web scraping tool that we have presented to you as Scrape.do, you can quickly obtain data and visualize the data you obtain so that your business will be in the foreground.

Information is the most valuable thing in today’s world and we need big data to get the information. Unfortunately, the data available for download on the web is not always sufficient for us. We obtain this data through the “data scraping” process. After the said data is extracted from the source, it becomes more analyzable to obtain much valuable information. Data scraping is an extremely valuable tool for obtaining various important information about your competition in the market. In this article, we talked about what data scraping is, the stages of data scraping, the differences between these stages, the scraping process, data scraping methods, what can be done with data scraping, some pros and cons of data scraping.

Do not forget to contact us for detailed information! What is Data Scraping? Another name for data scraping is web data scraping. In short, it is the name given to the process of extracting or “scraping” data from a website. Unlike the ordinary method of manually extracting data, data scraping uses intelligent automation to extract hundreds, thousands, millions, and even billions of data points from the seemingly endless edge of the internet world. Data scraping works for us in many different areas. Among the things we can do with data, scraping is price monitoring, outsourcing data for finance, sentiment analysis, and news and content tracking, which we’ll cover in this article. Now, let’s examine what is data scraping, which consists of two stages. What are the Data Scraping Stages? The data scraping process consists of a total of two stages. These stages are: ‍ Web Crawling : A web crawler, commonly referred to as a “spider”, is a system that scans the internet and collects extensions to search for the content we are looking for. It can be artificial intelligence or a human being mentioned here. ‍ Web Scraping : Special tools designed to extract data accurately and quickly from any web page. Web scrapers vary widely in design and complexity, depending on the project. Learn More Differences between web scraping and web crawling As Scrape.do experts we will explain the differences between web crawling and web scraping but before we do, we think you would like to know more about what they are and how they work. So, let's get … ‍ Differences Between Web Scraping and Web Crawling The concepts called web browsing and web scraping express different processes from each other. Basically, web browsing is a process performed by search engines such as Google, Yandex, Yahoo, and Bing that we use frequently in our daily life, or by tools that imitate the behavior of these search engines. Transactions are carried out through a browser called a “spider”. Spiders can only act for a certain behavior, such as only audio files or only visuals. All links are found and fetched by scanning through a source extension. From the start extension, the scanning process navigates the domain frame and monitors the status of connections. Web scraping, on the other hand, can also accommodate crawling. The target extension is scanned for a specific purpose and is removed from the scanned page after the specified information is found. For example, we can think of price information, phone number, address, content, or part of the content. The mentioned process can be done through a mark such as location, tag, class, or id. On the other hand, scraping can only be performed based on the specified extensions, even without scanning. For this purpose, resources such as sitemap files, product XML, and RSS feeds can be used. What are the Data Scraping Process and Data Scraping Methods? We have seen the data scraping stages in two articles under the previous title. Now we will talk about the methods of data scraping and the data scraping process. First of all, we need to determine which data we will get from which source, that is, we need to clarify. Then the experienced scraping team develops a scraper that is specific to your project to specifically target and extract the data you want from the websites you want. This first stage of the process is of great importance for the continuity of the process. ‍ The targeted data is received in HTML format and then carefully parsed to extract the desired raw data from the surrounding noise. Depending on the project in question, the data can be as simple as a name and address in some cases, or it can be more complex data. The data cleaned as a result of all these processes can optionally be stored in databases or CSV, JSON, or TSV files. What Can Be Done With Data Scraping? Through data scraping, many projects like these can be done and even added value to individuals and companies. ‍ Price Monitoring : It can be used in projects such as dynamic pricing, competitor analysis, and investment decision-making for your product or products by collecting data from different electronic commerce sites. ‍ Outsourcing Data for Finance : Social media data and outsourcing data that can be used in addition to financial risk reports of customers in the finance sector are also of great importance. It is very difficult to calculate credit risk, especially for an individual who has not been registered with banks before. Banks can try to predict whether the individual will be able to pay the loan by looking at the movements of the individual on social media, or they can do a psychology test from an external source. ‍ Sentiment Analysis : It is of great importance for your company to know how perception is formed about your company on social media platforms. You can actively increase your potential customer expectation and experience by constantly scraping and analyzing social media data by establishing a sentiment analysis model to learn how perception is formed. ‍ News and Content Monitoring : You can instantly follow what is said about your company, what kind of news is made about your company, not only on social media, but also on all existing media platforms, and you can take actions accordingly. You can clarify your decisions about what to do. Some Pros of Web Scraping for Your Business Here how web scraping can benefit your business: ‍ Competition Analysis : In today’s world, almost everything goes on the internet, and today, countless products are sold on e-commerce platforms. In addition, the e-commerce industry has made a huge leap in the market over the past decade, making it much more difficult for entrepreneurs to stay in the market due to fierce competition between retailers. This is exactly where web scraping services can give your business a method of survival. Web scraping can serve your current business with the latest market and competitor data, and you can find out how your competitors are doing in the market. ‍ Price Optimization and Monitoring : Pricing policy is probably one of the most important strategies of the business. Estimating the price at which a product should be sold in the market is indeed a difficult task. The price of the product should be kept at a level that customers can buy at the same time and enable the organization to make a profit. Whether you buy a different product or a similar one, it can be quite difficult to find an affordable price. Using a web scraping organization will help you see the prices that competitors have set for the same product, and after analyzing the price tracking database, you can determine the optimal price for the product or service. In addition to all this, web scraping allows you to keep track of new product launches and promotional events promptly. ‍ Lead Generation : Lead generation helps an organization capitalize on leads, which can result in conversions to leads. Web scraping is generally used to attract leads and find marketing and sales solutions for the sales rep. It can scrape information from all sources and central points with high potential customer activity. Web scraping makes the whole process faster. And not only that, but it also provides high sales data accuracy. ‍ Equity and Financial Research : Web scraping is creating an explosion in today’s investment world. Since important financial decisions can be made over time, it can automatically extract and present numerous financial data in a usable format. Talking more about data, web scraping can extract historical data even more effectively. Companies can use this data to feed machines for training modules. ‍ Product Optimization : While we socialize, we want to know other people’s opinions about the product in question before purchasing. Because the review of a different customer than us can significantly affect our decision whether to buy that product or not. This is exactly why web browsing helps us collect customer feedback data for cross-review and make product improvements to meet your customer’s expectations. Web scraping can automate the extraction process faster, and it saves a lot of effort and time for this type of work. Some Cons of Web Scraping for Your Business Before you can do web scraping, you will either need to learn a programming language, use web scraping software, or pay a developer. If you have a desire to collect and organize large amounts of information over the internet, you will find that the available web scraping software is limited in functionality. Because even if the software is useful and sufficient to extract a few items from a web page, they are less effective when you need to crawl multiple websites. For such reasons, you will need to invest in learning web scraping techniques in a programming language such as javascript, ruby, go, PHP or python. Websites regularly change their structure and browsers require maintenance . Your browsers can sometimes break as websites regularly change their HTML structure. Whether you’re writing web scraping code or using web scraping software, there are regular maintenance requirements to keep your data collection lines clean and operational. IP detection. Investing in proxies is a very smart move if you intend to crawl or data mining for a website. This is because if you want to crawl a large website, you have limited the possibility of your IP being banned to send enough daily HTTP requests using a Proxy. Data is of particular importance to every business, and the points mentioned above are only a fraction of what web scraping can do for you.

Before we talk about the concept of big data and its importance in today’s world, we need to understand the concept of data. Roughly, data is the name given to the raw piece of real information. Data are obtained by counting, measuring, experimenting, surveying, or observing. Data obtained through counting or measurement is called quantitative data, and data that does not report a numerical value is called qualitative data. In this article, we told you what the concept of big data is, what the components of this concept are, what are the uses of big data, what are the advantages and disadvantages of big data, and finally, the importance of big data for our lives.

Big data, whose name we are starting to hear quite often today, has increasing importance in today’s world. This growing importance is what the Harvard Business Review calls the “revolution of big data”. Big data is a phenomenon that has been put forward by software companies that carry out research and development activities to transform the information stacks created by different sources such as search engines, social media platforms, information-document archives, machine data, and log files into meaningful data by processing them. ‍ Five Important Components of Big Data to Know The phenomenon called big data consists of five main components. The five main components mentioned here can be listed as variety, velocity, volume, verification, and value. Now let’s explain these components. ‍ Variety: A significant part of the data produced has different formats. Data coming from tens of different devices, from different languages , and different systems naturally lead to the emergence of different formats. ‍ Velocity: In today’s globalizing world, the technological opportunities that are increasing due to the developing technology with a great and unstoppable speed naturally cause the amount of data obtained, the number of transactions to be done and the natural result of these, the variety of transactions to be made to increase in the right proportion. ‍ Volume: The obtained data should be stored accurately and efficiently, and for this, very good editing is required. If the existing data cannot be properly stored, it is hardly appropriate to speak of its proper processing as a natural consequence. ‍ Verification: If we are talking about countless data to be obtained, their security and accuracy are also extremely important. By whom and under what conditions all the obtained data will be viewed, and the issues that this data should be kept confidential are issues that need to be studied with great care. ‍ Value : The most important of the components related to big data is value. The data obtained and processed is meaningful only as long as it can add value to the organization. For this reason, it should be the primary goal that the analysis and simulations of big data are set up correctly and that it benefits the organization that uses/uses big data. What are the Uses of Big Data? Let’s explore where we use the big data. ‍ Banking : With the use of big data, banks can see the details of money movements. In some cases, banks can predict and prevent possible disasters or theft. ‍ Media, communication, and entertainment : The use of big data in the fields of cinema, journalism, television broadcasting, game organizations, and communication is quite common. The source of this situation is that customers can now access the content that is offered from anywhere and on the device they want. ‍ Social media : On some social media platforms, the total number of shares made in one day can exceed three hundred million. That’s more than ten million shares every hour. The statistical numbers are given here explain the importance of big data to us mathematically. ‍ Customer satisfaction : Customer satisfaction, which is among the areas of use of big data, is especially useful in measuring customer satisfaction through social media. ‍ Health : Thanks to big data, it is possible to review the images or trends of some diseases and therefore to diagnose them early. This method both reduces costs and increases the quality of health services. It offers a great opportunity. ‍ Production : Big data is used to support decision-making and decision-making processes in the fields of production and sourcing. For companies to gain a competitive advantage, forecasting models that extract information from geographical, textual, temporal, and graphical elements of big data are used. ‍ Insurance : A better price adjustment can be made by using big data in the insurance field. Big data, which provides the opportunity to establish stronger customer relationships, can increase the profitability and performance of insurance organizations. ‍ Retail : Among the benefits of using big data in retailing, big data is used to display stocks accurately. ‍ Transportation : Government agencies can use big data to control traffic, plan the best transportation route, and develop smart transportation systems ‍ Energy : Big data helps provide better workforce management and resource management, identify and quickly review problems encountered before failures occur. ‍ Measurement : In social fields such as marketing, psychology, and public policies, fixed-prone, and indirect behavior data that is specific to the person can be used. In the above articles, we talked about some of the usage areas of big data. Even if they do not constitute all of the usage areas of big data, they constitute a large and important part of it. Sharing on social media, especially when they are made directly from personal accounts, makes a great contribution to big data and therefore they have a very important place for companies working with big data. Advantages and Disadvantages of Big Data The increase in the amount of data obtained can create both advantages and disadvantages. Overall, having more data on leads and customers should allow companies with big data to better tailor products and marketing efforts to create optimal levels of satisfaction and repeat business. It offers companies that collect large amounts of data the opportunity to conduct deeper analysis for the benefit of all partners. Considering the amount of personal data available about individuals in today’s world, the steps companies take to protect this existing data are very important. In today’s online world, it is a hot topic of discussion with dozens of data breaches that companies experience. Although better analysis is a positive thing, big data has the potential to reduce its usefulness by creating overload and noise. Therefore, companies must process larger volumes of data and determine which data represent signals compared to noise. Making sure what makes the data relevant is an extremely important factor. In addition, the format and nature of the data are likely to require special handling before processing. Structured data consisting of quantitative values ​​can be easily sorted and stored easily. Unstructured data such as e-mails, text documents, and videos may require more sophisticated techniques to be applied before they are useful. The concept we call big data is a term that describes large volumes of data. However, what matters here is what companies do with the data rather than the amount of data. Analyzes of this data are essential for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business actions. In short, the importance of big data is not how much data you have, but how you can evaluate the data you have obtained. Cost reduction and time savings in various fields can be achieved through big data. By interpreting the data obtained while developing a new product or service, more efficient products or services can be produced according to the wishes and needs of the potential user. What are Big Data Examples? The sources of big data are innumerable. Today, due to the continuous advancement of technology, the resources of almost everything are increasing, and the resources of big data are increasing day by day. Of course, we’re not going to shy away from talking about the myriad of sources and give a few examples. Some examples we can give are transaction processing systems, customer databases, electronic mails, medical records, internet clickstream logs, social networks, and mobile applications. In addition, it includes machine-generated data, such as network and server log files, as well as data from sensors in manufacturing machines, industrial equipment, and IoT devices. In addition to the data coming from the internal systems, some examples of which we have mentioned above, big data environments generally include consumers, financial markets, geographic information, scientific research. Includes external data on climbs, weather and traffic conditions, and more. Images, videos, and audio files are also big data formats, and many big data applications include stream data that is constantly being processed and collected. Importance of Big Data for Our Lives Big data is based entirely on the analysis of real data. It is a concept that first entered our lives in 1998 with the presentation of John Mashey called “Big Data and Infrastructure Tension Wave”. As the name suggests, the concept on which big data is based is data. The aforementioned data are obtained through observation and measurement values ​​without any processing. Data on their own are meaningless and cannot be used on their own. The aforementioned data can be obtained from the research, observations, social media, various sensors in our devices, and many different environments. The concept we call big data is the set of all these data obtained. When we look at the most successful companies in today’s world, their most important common feature is that they accurately predict the demands and needs of users by using the data they have obtained and big data. It not only ensures the profits of the companies but also helps to prevent the losses thanks to the accurate forecasts. ‍If we look at it from a different perspective, there are also discussions that data can create privacy and security problems. When we give this data to companies and states that have a large area in the technology world, we are giving all our privacy, and therefore, the fact that states have this data is now a sign of power to a great extent. The more data we have about an individual, the more predictions we have about the decisions that an individual can make. The reason for the wars that may break out soon maybe data rather than land and oil as in the past. Because in today’s world, power is knowledge, not population or weapons. And we reach information through data. Data is very important to us and useful in many ways. For example, you need a new computer to do your work and you come across advertisements about it. A relative of yours has told you that he needs a new car, and you come across advertisements and campaigns about it. All of this and more is made possible by big data. We don’t usually pay for the social media apps we use, and we think we’re providing all access for free. These companies take our data as fees, not our money. Finally, it is useful to remind the famous saying: If you don’t pay for the product you are the product!

Dive into the rich history of this powerful data extraction technique.", "h1": "Explore The History of Web Scraping", "content": "Web scraping, which was first developed to automate tasks that are complex or troublesome for people and used for this purpose, has started to be used for commercial purposes over time. The history of web scraping , which is used for data scraping, data scraping, or data collection through websites, goes back to the times when the internet first emerged. Although the web scraping method is generally described as collecting data from the contents on the internet, it has not always been used for this purpose. Web scraping, which was first developed to automate tasks that are complex or troublesome for people and used for this purpose, has started to be used for commercial purposes over time. The commercial usage areas of this application can be listed as scraping the product prices of the competitors, increasing the number of potential customers by attracting the sales of the competitors, finding the missing aspects of the marketing campaigns, and eliminating these deficiencies. The general purpose of web scraping, which is used for commercial purposes, is to take the top place in the internet trade market by defeating the competitors. In this article, we told you what web scraping is, what web scraping is for, how web scraping was born, and the timeline of web scraping. We’ve also included a section at the end of the text about why you chose us, Scrape.do. After reading that section, you will understand in the best way why you should choose us. With the Scrape.do, which you can use to scrape websites better, you can easily access data on any website on the internet. Under normal circumstances, if your IP address is detected while web scraping, your IP address may be blocked manually by the owner of that website or automatically by the website’s codes. But you can overcome all of this by using Scrape.do, and with our very affordable packages! What are you waiting for to use Scrape.do? What is Web Scraping? By obtaining the data on any website beyond the control of the website owner, you can increase your online business like never before with web scraping, which allows you to use and categorize the content on the websites as you wish. Although web scraping is used today to retrieve data from a website in a categorized way, this method was formerly used to connect with test frameworks. Companies like IP-Label, which use tools like Selenium, used this method to make it easier for their web developers and administrators to monitor the performance of their websites. Scraping data from the Internet is very similar to web indexing, the process by which many listed websites come up when you search for any search query in search engines. The most important difference between indexing internet sites and obtaining data from the internet is robots.txt software, this software is software that gives the bots accessing the internet where to go. Web indexers, that is, search engines that index websites, do not conflict with robots.txt software and act in harmony. Web scraper tools, on the other hand, cannot work in harmony with the robots.txt file, as they are responsible for stealing and illegally obtaining content from websites. Let’s add that web scrapers obtain data by visiting websites and discover new pages by logging into seed pages, and by this way they can access data on a website. How Web Scraping Method Was Born? Although Google is often regarded as the first browser to fully scan websites and the web, let us tell you that surfing and accessing data on websites have a long and rather interesting history than you might think. Although the first browsers on the internet could only scan data and text on websites, today’s internet data scanning tools can now monitor web applications other than internet browsing in terms of security vulnerabilities and accessibility. When the internet was first invented and used, it was not possible to search on the internet. In this period, when there was no search engine, people could access the files shared with them via FTTP (File Transfer Protocol) rather than finding the files they wanted. People needed an automated program to better share data with each other, so they invented and started using a program known as Web Browser and Bot to meet these needs. It has become possible to organize all files with the Web Browser, which allows them to find files uploaded to the Internet to be shared with other users over the Internet. This automatic software, called a web browser or bot and used to access files on the internet, aims to index all the content on the websites and extracts the data on the website to a certain database to perform the indexing process. Since the first web browsers were developed for a very small internet, these web browsers could scan approximately one hundred thousand internet pages. If we look at our current position, we can say that some websites only have millions of pages on their own sites. Since millions of new web pages were added to the internet with the help of the search engines created, it was necessary to add internet data such as audio, video, pictures, and texts. After this data was designed to be uploaded to the internet by the developers of the internet, the internet turned into a completely open data source. Thanks to the internet, which can be easily searched and you can reach the data you want by simply searching the search queries, we have a real data source. As people have also expanded their use of the internet, it has become easier for people to start sharing the information they want publicly. Although sharing data seemed like a simple process, many websites did not allow direct downloading of the data on their pages. The internet has become increasingly inefficient, as websites that cannot be downloaded directly require manual copying of data. There was a need for an application to automatically obtain data on the Internet, which became web scraping. Timeline of Web Scraping History The history of web scraping can be examined under six headings: the birth of the World Wide Web, the first web browser, Wanderer, JumpStation, BeautifulSoup, and the birth of visual web scrapers. Birth of the World Wide Web If you are wondering how far the history of scraping any website on the Internet goes, we can say that this method has its origins in the creation of the World Wide Web. The birth of the World Wide Web in this timeline dating back to 1989 was accomplished by Tim Berners-Lee. The original purpose of the World Wide Web was to be a platform for information exchange between scientists at universities and institutes around the world who need up-to-date information. But the World Wide Web developed quite quickly and three different features occurred. URL Used to introduce a particular website to the scraper, which is used to scrape data from the internet. Embedded Hyperlinks They contribute to our navigation on the websites we specify. Web pages They can be characterized as data pages containing various data such as text, images, audio, video and visual content. The First Web Browser Tim Berners-Lee, who founded the World Wide Web and made it possible to exchange information around the world, did not stop after developing the World Wide Web and decided to develop a way for people to access the World Wide Web. After two years of work, he invented the first web browser with a web page running on a server. Thanks to this web browser, it was possible for people to log into the network and share things with other people over the network. Wanderer Wanderer, a Perl-based web browser for measuring the size of the network, was the first of its kind. This web browser was developed by Matthew Gray of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After it was decided to develop Wanderer, this web browser was used to create an index called Wandex instead of measuring the size of the World Wide Web. Wanderer with Wandex was a web browser with the potential to become the first general-purpose World Wide Web search engine, although Matthew Gray, the founder of Wanderer, described this idea as a mere assertion. JumpStation In 1993, when Wanderer and Wanderer with Wandex emerged, JumpStation, a technology that formed the basis of search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, began to be used. The first browser-based search engine, this software is a basic and fairly simple version of the search engines we currently have. As JumpStation became more and more popular, it was only a matter of time before millions of web pages appeared and were added to the index of this application. We can easily say that the internet has turned into an open-source data platform with JumpStation. BeautifulSoup BeautifulSoup was released in 2004, just eleven years after JumpStation, Wanderer, and Wanderer with Wandex came out in 1993. Written in the Python programming language, this library contained widely used algorithms, and it was possible to describe this library as an HTML parser. With BeautifulSoup, the meanings of the structures of the websites could be understood and it became possible to parse all the data contained in HTML containers. The ability to easily parse data in HTML form was a development that reduced the workload and working hours of programmers. ‍The internet, where anyone with a computer and internet connection can log in and access the information they want with the help of a search engine, has become a real source of information for people. It was also possible for people to receive important information from the information presented to them and to facilitate their lives with the help of this information. Although the internet did not prohibit downloading content on its pages in the early stages of its development, this system has changed over time and data has become difficult to download. In projects where a large amount of data was to be reviewed, manual and human-powered copying and pasting was a difficult task, so people had to find a new way to obtain the data. The Rise of Visual Web Scrapers When people started to be unable to download the data they wanted to get from the internet for offline use, a new way had to be discovered, this newly discovered way called web scraping. Visual web scraping software, Web Integration Platform version 6.0, was software developed by Stefan Andresen that could answer people’s needs. Thanks to this software, users could highlight the information they deem necessary on the web page. As a result of this emphasis, the data they wanted to have were saved in an excel file or a database, so it became very easy to scrape data over the internet. The web scraping method, which is an ongoing and frequently used technology today, is a method that develops the more the technology advances. Since the number of companies on the Internet is increasing day by day and people need the advantage to make their companies stand out, they use web scraping to access existing information on the internet and try to find a way to put their companies ahead. Thanks to this method, which is most frequently used to obtain data on a large scale, it becomes possible to gain potential customers by leaving competitors behind.

But still, someone has to reach some sort of web browser to send you these hypothetical screenshots. Shortly, browsers are parts of software that render web pages that show you the page on your device. Browsers are turning codes from servers to make sure you could have seen some meaningful and readable texts, images, pop-ups, animations, and so on, on your devices. Shortly, everything that comes to mind. However, browsers also ensure you interact with the pages via clicking on them, scrolling them, and swiping them. How Does Browsers Work? Actually, your device, let’s say a computer, does the work. Thousands of HTTP requests are sent by the browsers to the server.  Later, your browser needs to reach the raw HTML page content. After that, it will be a pain in the neck by making a string of further requests to the server to provide additional elements such as images and fonts. ‍ As you know, most websites are built on HTML and CSS. And, they have to provide rich and interactive experiences to the users. In other words, we can say that most modern websites depend on the JavaScrpit which is rendering all nice content on a page and is real-time to make sure that users have a nice surfing experience. I believe you all saw what happened when a website loads in ages. Yes, it is really boring and painful to wait. But if you have waited, you must have seen that the bare-bones elements of the website appear first. A few seconds later, you must have seen the dull-looking text will disappear and be rendered in a nice and cool font with other elements of the website. This is JavaScript’s work. Headless Browsers The browsers need to understand, download, decide what to do with these, and have to render all of the information that is served from websites such as tracking codes, user analytics codes, social media codes, and so on. In this scenario, let’s think of you as a person that wants to write a scraping script that helps you to automate the extracting data process from various websites. There are lots of possibilities. In another scenario, let’s say you have to write a code that compares products’ prices between different online marketplaces. It will be so hard to do it if the product’s price does not be found on the raw HTML code. Whether you compare prices on different online marketplaces or write all of the codes on your own, you need an automated solution for sure. Well, it is also near impossible to hire hundreds of people and expect them to write down everything they saw. Here’s what I say, that is why you need headless browsers! Okay, so what are headless browsers actually? A headless browser is giving a clue about itself actually with the name “headless”. The headless browsers are not under the control of any human. They interact with websites by the graphical interface and basically mouse movements. Scraping, Data Extraction and Headless Browsers Instead of hiring hundreds of people to interact with a website and save information one by one, you simply write code that tells the headless browser where to go and what to get from a page. Yes, it really is that simple. Thus, you can have an automatically created page and get all the information you need easily and effortlessly. There are some programmatic interfaces available for browsers. Basically, all programmatic interfaces do a similar job. So much so that it lets you write code that tells the browser to visit a page, click a link, hover over an image, and take a screenshot of what it sees. So, is the best way to scrape to use a headless browser? Actually, there is no definite answer to this. This really depends on the situation.Most popular scraping frameworks don’t usually use headless crawlers. This is because headless browsers are not the best way to get data in most use cases. However, we can say that scraping is available for the benefit of people and their interaction with their websites. However, scrapers often do not actually care if there is a noteworthy image on a page. The scraper will only see the raw HTML code. This means that it is not easy for humans to read, but highly effective and legible for a machine. Explore more: How can data scraping benefit your business ‍"},

Let’s learn about what web scraping technology is in detail before moving on. In today’s world, almost everything is going digital. While companies that can keep up with the said digitalization survive and strengthen themselves, companies that cannot keep up and try to deal with their business with traditional methods are being dragged into bankruptcy. In this article, we tried to clear your mind about web scraping, which we have been hearing a lot about recently. As the Scrape.do team, we promise stable, reliable, and rocket-fast data scraping! Leave the data scraping you need to us and find time to focus on your work! You can contact us to get support from our expert staff.‍ What is Web Scraping? What is web scraping, which we have been hearing a lot about lately? Let’s take a look at it together. Web scraping is the name given to the process of extracting information from websites by scraping. Generally, these software programs simulate human exploration of the World Wide Web (WWW) via low-level HTTP or various full-fledged embedded web browsers. After the information in question is collected from the relevant websites, a spreadsheet, for example, is made more useful for users. Web scraping does not have to be done automatically, it can also be done manually. However, automatic methods are preferred because they are both faster and less costly. Web scraping is not as simple a process as it seems. Websites can take many different forms. Therefore, as we will talk about in the rest of our article, web scraping programs vary in terms of both their functions and features. Different types of web scrapers Web scrapers can vary in their functions and features. Under this heading, we will talk about 4 types of web scrapers. Self/Pre-Built Today, every individual with the necessary and sufficient technical knowledge can create a web scraper. However, this process is not as simple as it is thought and requires advanced programming knowledge. The amount of information that will be useful to you here is directly proportional to the number of qualities you want your scraper to have. In other words, the more detailed and more features you want, the more technical knowledge you need to have. Creating your scrape program will usually only take a few minutes if you don’t want too many features. You can use search engines to learn how. Rather than creating your scrape program, there are many web scrapers that you can quickly download and install on your device. Moreover, these programs are not simple and useless. On the contrary, these programs have many more, such as scrape timing, JSON and Google Sheets export options. Therefore, whether you have the technical knowledge or not, such programs will save you time. Software <-> Browser Extension Web scrapers can generally appear in two different ways. These are extensions that can be installed as add-ons to our browsers such as Google Chrome and the like. Many of us have various add-ons in our browsers. Therefore, these plugins can also be used for web scraping. The first plus of the extensions you add to your browser for web scraping is that they work easily and are directly integrated into your browser. However, even if we say that it is simple to install such extensions on your browser, we must say that it is not as simple as installing an ad-blocker extension on your browser. And the biggest disadvantage of these extensions is that they do not allow the implementation of an advanced feature that needs to happen outside of your browser. In other words, they are extensions that you can only operate with your browser. Another option is a software program that you install on your device. Although these programs are not useful from an extension you will install on your browser, we can say that the extension you will install on your browser removes the restrictions placed on you. Both options have their pros and cons. You will be the decision-maker here. In other words, what you expect from the scrape process you want to do will be the factor that directly affects your decision. ‍ UI Presenting to Users The UI (User Interface) that web scrapers offer to their users varies. As an example, some web scraping tools include a very minimalist UI, while others include a UI that is as user-friendly as can be. Tools with minimal UI probably work with a command line. This is the system that older generation users are used to. However, some new generation users find this system complex. Because of this, they tend to choose more innovative and user-friendly interfaces. This is not just a distinction between the old generation and new generation users. Habits and tastes also come into play here. For example, if you are an old-generation programmer, but are interested in new-generation designs and a relatively simple interface, you can choose a user-friendly interface. Similarly, if a new generation of users is more comfortable and likes minimalist designs, they may prefer simple interfaces. In addition, users with insufficient technical knowledge prefer user-friendly UIs. Local <-> Cloud Where exactly does your web scraper do its job? The answer to your question is very important. Local web scrapers will run on your computer and use their resources on your computer. One downside of this situation is that if your web scraper is using a large amount of RAM and/or CPU, your device will slow down during the scraping process, freezes and hangs may occur, and maybe your computer will shut down. At best if you don’t have high system specs, you will have to be away from your computer for hours in a long scraping. On top of all this, let’s add that if your web scraper is set up to run on multiple extensions, it can cause you trouble as it can negatively affect your internet service provider’s data caps. Cloud-based web scrapers, on the other hand, as the name suggests, run on an offsite server via the cloud system. This means that while your web scraper is running, it will use the power and resources of the server it is connected to, not the power and resources of your computer. This will lighten a load of your computer a lot compared to local web scrapers. Therefore, if you do not have a high system, it is recommended to use the cloud system. In addition to these, the cloud system should not cause any anxiety in you. Because systems are usually implemented with advanced servers provided by highly reliable companies. Moreover, you will be notified after your web scraping is done and when your scraping is ready for export. In Which Sectors is Web Scraping Most Used? Web scraping is essential for many industries. For a trading platform, web scraping is used in many areas, including market research, indexing the prices of products to market prices, identifying potential customers, analyzing competitors and/or platforms, what people think about your business, and companies’ valuation of real estate, finance, and investment. Now let’s examine these things in a little more detail. Let’s talk about market research first . First, we need to understand what market research is. Market research is the process of gathering information about your competitors and prospects, asking questions, and evaluating your results before entering a market when considering starting a business/company. The method by which we can collect the said data in the fastest and most reliable way is, of course, the web scraping method. With the web scraping technique, companies can access high volume and high-quality web data with the potential to be a turning point of great importance in the decisions they will take in the future. With web scraping, you can even do market trend analysis, entry point optimization, and market pricing using an API scraper. ‍ Second , we’ll start with pricing. As many of you know, businesses or companies do not randomly determine the prices of their products. There are many factors in the pricing process. The data that can be accessed by the web scraping method are important parameters such as pricing of competing companies, data such as existing stock, and product description. After obtaining this information, any company makes a price optimization for the product, and in this way, it makes a much more effective entry into the market in question. This process can be called “price intelligence”. Web scraping is one of the most effective and fastest methods that can be used to provide price intelligence. ‍ Third , we’ll talk about identifying potential customers and even generating customers. Let’s say you own a company. You want to build a customer base for your company. You will need more than a few customers to compete with your competitors in the industry. First, you need to create a customer base. You need to enter platforms such as LinkedIn. With web scraping, you can do customer analysis and determine how you can attract customers. But the work does not end here. You should analyze the requests of your potential customers well and use this method to protect your potential customers and increase your customer base by getting support from web scraping to compete with rival companies. ‍ Fourth , you need to analyze your competitors. You will have many competitors in the sector you will enter or in. If you analyze your opponent’s correctly and make the right moves, you will be more likely to get ahead of them. With the web scraping method, you can thoroughly analyze your competitors no matter what your industry or target industry is. Of course, analysis can be done without web scraping, but the more dynamic your industry is, the harder your job will be. Web scraping will give you both speed and reliable information on this, and these are huge advantages over the competition. With the speed of web scraping, you can access data from many companies in a short time, compare them and determine your moves. The fifth thing we will talk about is learning what people and your competitors think about your company. It is much more important than one might think. So much so that what your competitors think about you is very important for your next step. Because if you control their thoughts about you, you can make moves that can get ahead of your competitors. In addition, it is very important to know what your potential customers or existing customer base think of your company. In this regard, taking advantage of the blessings of the internet will provide you with a great speed and advantage. What we mean is, by using the web scraping method, you can instantly follow the thoughts and opinions of people and competitor companies for your company through your company’s public relations and marketing departments. The sixth thing we will talk about is your company’s real estate. In today’s world, companies are faced with a major digital transformation. So much so that companies that wanted to remain loyal to the traditional structure could not be successful in this way and these companies were driven to bankruptcy. With the help of web scraping, companies can assess their real estate values, monitor vacancy rates, predict potential rental and sales revenues, and gain immense speed and precision advantages in the market compared to working with traditional methods. ‍ The last thing we will talk about is investment and finance. For a company to grow and survive, it is essential to invest and master financial data. Developing financially or at least protecting its value is of great importance for the survival of a company, and this financial development is possible through tools such as investment. Being able to see what to invest in, optimized graphics is quite difficult without technology and especially web scraping. Web scraping quickly provides your company with accurate data on this and gives a huge advantage over traditional methods.

What Is Price Monitoring With Web Scraping and Why Is It Important? If you have decided to sell any goods or services on the Internet, you need to set prices suitable for the market in order to gain customers. Affordable price, unfortunately, is not the price that customers want to buy by running, or the price that you will earn in very high amounts. If you really want to decide on a reasonable and correct price, you should first get detailed information about the market. You should use a web scraper to find out how other businesses are pricing their products and how much these products are selling. In this way, you will determine the right price and you will learn how to increase the sales of your products. Although consumers try to save money while searching for a product on the Internet and always prefer cheap products, businesses that work for this are almost never successful. This is because they have lower prestige and earn a lower profit because they lower the prices of their products to sell more. If you do not want to encounter such a situation, you should follow the price using a web scraper. How to Optimize Prices After Web Scraping With price monitoring, which is one of the most important advantages of scraping data from the Internet, you can make your life easier and make your business bigger one day by day. To use this method, you can use a web scraper that can make a list of prices available in the market. If you want to understand how you can increase prices without losing customers, pay attention to the caveats listed below: The prices you set blindly will not be the prices that will bring you profit. Learn about the prices, pricing strategies, and sales of competing businesses selling the same style of products. And don’t forget to use a web scraper to get this information. Learning how to meet customers’ needs is essential to the development of a business, so use a web scraper to analyze customers’ behavior as well. If you want to stand out in the market and want to get more customers, use web scraping to find out where your competitors are making mistakes and correct yourself if you are making these mistakes. Try to improve the quality of the products you sell online, and you can also attract more customers by improving your delivery services. Try to time change the costs and benefits of the products you sell or the services you provide for a fee. For this, you can easily follow the price changes in the market by using a web scraper. If you want to maximize your earnings, you need to have a dynamic pricing strategy. For this, you should constantly monitor the prices of competitors and make changes according to the changes. ‍ How to Do Customer Analysis Using Web Scraping? Customer analysis, which is used to evaluate the behavior of your customers or customers of competitors, is a method that reveals the attitudes of customers towards a certain product or a certain service. Do not care too much whether the feedback you receive is positive or negative, remember that all negative or positive feedback will always be useful to you. Having customer feedback to reveal the pros and cons of your products is a huge plus! You can get these reviews, which are completely public, with web scraping, as tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of users share their different experiences and reviews about different products on the internet every day. Thanks to this feedback you get, you can better understand the personality of your target audience, make special offers, improve your products and services, plan sales and marketing strategies for the future, get an idea about future trends, and change the prices of your products and services in a timely manner.

Social media platforms that your potential customers often use. The interests of your potential customers. The types of customers who bought your products.

Although online shopping has become a very popular shopping method in recent years, many criteria play a role in the selection of online shopping sites. The most important of these criteria is the online reputation of that website. Online reputation is an important criterion that shows how reliable a website is to potential customers who shop online. If you do not have an online reputation or if you have a reputation but this reputation is completely negative, users who shop on the internet will not prefer your website and will definitely not buy your products and services. If you want your website to sell more and you aim to increase your earnings, you should make sure that your website is completely reliable and put your website’s online reputation first. ‍ If you want to improve your company’s image and online reputation, you should consider all comments and feedback on you and your products, and check these comments and feedback regularly. In addition, you should be able to see the feedback instantly and respond quickly to these feedbacks when necessary.

F,nd out a lot about scraping Google Analytics data now!", "h1": "Scraping Google Analytics for Optimization Studies", "content": "You know how Google Analytics can be beneficial for your business / website optimization process. In this article, you will see a lot about scraping Google Analytics data. Let’s see. When people are very limited in doing research on the internet and they need big data, they resort to data extraction, or web scraping as we know it. In this sense, we can see that the reliable data of Google Analytics are scraped and used in optimization studies. What is Web Scraping? The data is presented as accessible by people or other systems for different purposes and in different channels. This access can be open or limited. It is not a requirement for the data to be human-readable at the stage of recording and presenting it. But for blog content, social media stream, or an article in pdf format, of course, readability will be an important criterion. This is how search engines to scan, interpret and classify content in the context of the algorithms used. This whole process is expressed in a general term; data scraping. Data scraping, in general terms, refers to the process of extracting data from a data source by a computer program. Process of Web Scraping A URL is needed for web scraping. A request is made to the URL and the incoming response is scanned to extract the requested data from its content. Making and displaying requests is basically a web browser behavior. Hence, web crawling can qualify as the main component of web scraping. Many operations such as searching, filtering, parsing, reformatting, and copying can be performed within the response from the server. Web scraping can be used for various purposes such as browsing, journalism, web indexing, data mining, price and product tracking/comparison, and more. Web scraping can be performed with many different techniques on the basis of programming language and applications: JavaScript codes that can be processed through the developer tools and console of modern web browsers can be considered as one of the methods. Different solutions can be considered, such as ScraperWiki5 and Selenium6. Libraries of programming languages ​​such as Python and R can be used. Can Google Analytics Export All Data? There is always an obligation to export all Google Analytics data at once. Users need historical data. They cannot manually export Google Analytics data for different time periods or ranges. However, you may see here 3 ways to export all Google Analytics data: Manually: It may take some time depending on the volume of data you have in Google Analytics. Export aggregate reports to Google Sheets using the Google Analytics plugin. Export bulk reports using the Google Analytics API. How to Export Data from Google Analytics? Google provides people to reach programmatic access to GA data via Reporting API V4. The data is structured in terms of dimensions and metrics. We can say dimensions are the factors based on collected data and the metrics are keys that provide info. Google Analytics provides us with a set of dimensions and metrics by default. Users are able to create their own dimensions and metrics just by making minor changes to the tracking code which is distributed with the website. To get raw hit-level data from Google Analytics, you should use some customized dimensions. Data Extraction with Python Some of the data conversion tools most commonly used by data scientists today are Python and R. Google Analytics is one of the main and reliable sources used to view reports in the field of digital marketing. On the other hand, if you need to do optimization studies or deep analysis like machine learning, you can use R or Python to extract data from Google. Why is Web Scraping Important? Web scraping provides many benefits to businesses, firms, research firms, researchers, journalists, and competing firms. Let’s examine: Price Monitoring By collecting data from various e-commerce sites, you can use it in projects such as dynamic pricing, competitor analysis, and investment decision-making for your product or products. Outsourcing Data for Finance In finance, social media data and external source data that can be used outside of customers’ financial risk reports are also very important. It is very difficult to calculate credit risk, especially for someone who has not registered with banks before, banks try to predict whether they will pay the loan by looking at the person’s actions on social media, or they do psychology tests from outside sources. Sentiment Analysis You can continuously increase your customer expectation and experience by constantly scraping and analyzing social media data by establishing a sentiment analysis model to learn how your company is perceived on social media. News and Content Tracking You can instantly follow what is said about you, what kind of news is made about your company, not only on social media but also on modern media, and you can take action accordingly. Also, you can also clarify your decision on how or where to invest by analyzing the data about the company you will invest in. In this sense, you can carry out many projects professionally and add added value to both yourself and your company. In the age of the internet where information is unlimited, the information obtained through data scraping can be very valuable.

Since the internet has a very important place today, all data on the internet becomes more important every day, and companies that sell over the internet or want to access data on the internet are automatically involved in data collection. Thanks to web scraping or data scraping, which we can call automatic data collection, instead of manually visiting websites and reading the data on these pages and extracting data, the desired pages can be scanned using scripts or web scrapers and the data on these pages can be easily extracted. Data extracted from a website is perfectly structured for later reuse and is then saved in databases, repositories, or files. ‍ What are Search Engine Results Pages? Search engine results pages or SERP, which list all results when you enter any search query, are a page that shows organic search results and paid search results. The organically listed search result is listed with a robust algorithm and only Google determines this list. While organic searches include the page title, page URL, and meta description, there are also frequent posts and site links. Paid search results, on the other hand, are the results marked with a small advertisement icon in the upper left corner of the article with the description and title of the website. Scraping Google Search Results Search engine optimization, which is necessary for your company to develop and become more popular, is a very necessary strategy for websites. If you do not include this strategy, which allows you to be more visible on the Internet, on your website, you will become invisible and your customers will be stolen by your competitor companies that rank higher on Google search engine results pages, so unless you do the search engine optimization correctly, you will be doomed to failure. It is quite common for these pages to be scraped, as Google search engine results pages contain data that is of great importance to every company listed on that page. Although a small part of the data of these companies is in Google Ads or Google Analytics, it is also possible to scrape the data of competing companies directly from Google. What can be Scraped from the Google Search Results Page? If you want to access the data of a competitor company that appears higher on the search engine results pages, we can say that you can access the following data in the table by scraping the Google search engine results pages: Organically ranked results Other queries related to the search query Prices on websites Advertisements of websites Questions people often ask Reviews of products or services In addition to the fact that all of the data you obtain can be extracted in real-time, it is also possible to save this data to files in JSON, XML, or CSV format. How Does Google Understand Scraping Operations? Since Google’s algorithm is cautious about scraping, it can detect the keywords that have been searched in a short time and the IP address, which is the identity of internet users trying to scrape the search results with minor changes in these keywords. Web scraping can also be detected by detecting the frequency of the number of access requests to a page on Google. What Do Search Engine Results Page Scrapers Do? Google, which is not against the application of web scraping, has taken some precautions such as the introduction of captcha and error pages to the search engine results pages by taking the precaution. Although these measures often prevent search engines from extracting large volumes of data from results pages, since the data on search engine results pages is a very valuable data source for personal, commercial, and industrial purposes, software developers tried to find some ways to avoid these obstacles. SERP scrapers that help you scrape search engine results pages were born for this need. What Are the Benefits of Scraping Google Search Results? Since the data on the Google search engine results pages provide serious information about competing companies or businesses, website owners are trying to scrape this data. Read on for a brief look at the benefits of scraping this data: One of the most important benefits of the Google search results data you get with the data scraping tool from the internet is that the data you get is completely accurate and you can get results faster with this data. It is possible to gather a list of e-mail addresses or phone numbers for the campaigns you organize to promote your products or services to other people by searching the Google search engine results pages. If there is a business that sells the same product you sell, you can find out by scraping the Google search engine results pages, you can compare your product with that product, and you can easily learn which aspects of your product you need to highlight. Some campaigns you want to organize may require you to download product images, which may take more time than necessary. But you can quickly get to the photos and data just by entering the keyword and using the Google SERP scraper. Scraping Benefits for Businesses ‍ Some Reasons You Should Scrape Google Search Results Page It has been seen that people aim to increase the ranking of the website by scraping the search engine results pages and checking how visible their products are compared to competing companies. In addition to these, you can improve your SEO strategy, review your marketing methods, conduct research, and search other websites using search engines using Google search engine results pages scraper. Improve Your SEO Strategy We all know how important the organic and online traffic generated by search engines is. Considering the degree of this importance, it can be said that search engine optimization is one of the best strategies you can use to improve your business. By obtaining the data on the search engine results pages, you can determine your ranking in the Google search engine results pages and review the rankings of your competitors. In addition to these benefits, it is possible to learn which keywords your competitors are using that you do not use or the most frequently used keywords in your field. This data from search engine results pages can also help you see which of your technical search engine optimization strategies are working and which are not. Review Your Marketing Methods By scraping the data of paid ads, which are one of the results on the search engine results pages, you can easily find out with which keywords these ads are in the first place and on the first page. Although it is quite easy to place paid advertising on search engines, you need to find keywords with high search volume and words with low bid value for your ad to reach the required audiences. To find these words, all you have to do is use a customized web scraper for search engine results pages. It also allows you, as a business, to see which products of competing businesses are advertising and how which products consumers are trending and how they are responding to the products they are trending. During these actions, you will also have the chance to apply these methods to your brand by obtaining useful feedback. Retrieve Data from Other Websites Although Google is the most frequently used search engine for scraping search engine results pages due to its status as the most popular search engine, you can also use a scraper on other websites that have search engines to collect data faster. Let us explain this with an example. A used car website has a specialized search engine that you can use to find specific search patterns. You can organize your search results in a fairly easy way using a search engine results page scraper. Thanks to this convenience provided, you can easily make the examination you want to do and define the car models you want. Conduct Research Whether it’s purely for personal and hobby purposes or to improve your business, a search engine should be preferred first to start any research. With a search engine results page scraper, you can easily provide data for the topics you are researching, and have the opportunity to gather all the data you need and research in one place. Scraping Tips for Best Search Engine Crawl Crawling search engine results pages can be more challenging than you think, as search engines have anti-bot systems and CAPTCHA protections that can block your crawl. If you don’t want to have trouble crawling search engines, try these methods: A robust, reliable, and consistent Proxy is needed for continuous IP address changes. You have to be careful that these Proxies are anonymous and fast, the IP addresses this Proxy offers should not have any bad history against Google. Try to use between fifty and one hundred and fifty different Proxies depending on the number of results from the search queries and the intensity of the ongoing scraping, keep in mind that some projects may require more than one hundred and fifty Proxies. Also, if your action is detected by Google’s anti-bot software, stop scraping immediately. As soon as your IP address changes, you should clear the cookies immediately or disable the IP addresses you have used before, otherwise, you are likely to be caught. Do not forget to add a few keywords that do not have more than a thousand results to the keywords you will search. You should also change your IP address immediately after the keyword change, as between three hundred and a thousand results can be obtained for each keyword you have chosen.

Based on the process of extracting data from predetermined websites, web scraping uses a type of software called web scrapers. Thanks to this software, the desired websites can be easily scraped and the information on the scraped websites can be saved in a file in a certain format. Here’s how these web scrapers work, step by step: First, the URL addresses of the websites that are requested to be scraped are added to the web scraper. Web scrapers extract the HTML codes of the added websites, making a list of even the content that is not possible to copy. The web scraper organizes the information it collects, such as price and customer feedback, in a way that people can read, and saves the information it has organized in a database or presents it to the user by turning it into a spreadsheet. Many websites have blockers to block web scrapers that are very easy to use and work on a simple principle. These scrapers are connected to Proxy to empower web scrapers to bypass these restrictions with ease. Proxies, which act as a barricade between your device and the internet server and send the information you want by intermediating to the website, are indispensable systems for web scrapers and without this system, web scrapers cannot work. The two most commonly used proxies for web scraping are residential proxies and data center proxies. What Are the Types of Web Scrapers? The web scrapers you use to scrape data from websites have their characteristics. These web scrapers come in four types: browser extensions, software, self-built web scrapers, and cloud-based scrapers. Let’s take a closer look at these scrapers and their features! Web Scrapers in the Form of Browser Extensions There are many web scrapers available in the form of a browser that you can easily access over the Internet. These web scrapers are scrapers that can be easily added to your browser and are very easy to operate. Although this software is easy to use, you cannot carry out large projects with these scrapers, which are in the form of a browser. The reason these scrapers are only usable in small projects is that they can only scrape for a single page in a single run. It is not possible to scrape any web page other than that page. Web Scrapers in the Form of Software These softwares, which you can use to scrape data on the Internet, are software that you can easily download and install from the Internet. Although these softwares usually have unique features, we can say that all software has advanced features and they are not simple web scrapers. Unlike web scrapers, which are in the form of browser extensions, web scrapers in software form can scrape multiple pages at once. These web scrapers are web scrapers used for medium and small-scale projects. For larger scraping, you need to use web scrapers that can work on a larger scale. Web Scrapers You Build Yourself If you wish, it is possible to create a web scraper that can scrape information from websites. However, if you have decided to create a web scraper yourself, you should remember that you must have advanced programming knowledge. If you do not have any programming expertise and you are trying to create a web scraper with the knowledge you have, we can safely say that the scrapers you create will not be functional. Also, since all web scrapers require constant maintenance, you need to constantly check your program and perform the necessary maintenance of your program regularly. Cloud-Based Web Scrapers Web scrapers that run through the cloud are more reliable as they run from a server created by the person you bought it from and have an off-site location. While the capacity of your computer will negatively affect the web scraping process with other web scrapers, your web scraping project will not be adversely affected if you use a cloud-based web scraper. You can also do other operations while your computer is taking care of web scraping, you cannot perform any operations from the computer when you are not using a cloud-based web scraper. When you hire cloud-based web scrapers, it will notify you when the scraper has finished extracting the data. You can use this scraper type for projects that need to scrape huge amounts of data. For What Purposes Can You Use Web Scraping? It is possible to find many kinds of data on the internet, which is developing and growing day by day and has a very large volume. There are several ways you can use the data you find on your e-commerce-based website. The most common uses of web scraping can be described as follows: ‍ Price tracking method: Many websites that sell on the Internet need to learn the prices of other websites, and they create a new marketing strategy for themselves thanks to this information, so price tracking is of great importance to rise in e-commerce. Many web scrapers are also designed for exactly this purpose. Web scrapers used to monitor prices on other retail websites and trends from other competitor companies will get you one step ahead. Real estate market: Web scrapers used for price monitoring and competitor analysis are also known to be used to monitor rentals and sales prices in a particular area. Although this use is usually used on real estate sites, this method can also be used by people who want to buy a house and enter the real estate sales business. Increasing the number of potential customers: Marketing professionals who want to increase the sales of services and products on certain websites also take the help of web scrapers. It is a well-known fact that marketers scrape data from many business-based websites such as LinkedIn. By scraping the information on these websites, the trends and expertise of potential customers can be easily learned. Customer feedback: Many companies that sell online or physically are curious about what their customers think about products and services. People love to share their thoughts on products and services online. For this reason, brands use web scrapers to understand how people view their products and services. What Factors Should You Consider When Choosing Any Web Scraper? People who want to obtain meaningful information from the data on the websites and use this information to improve the website should use the web scraping method. You need a web scraper for web scraping to happen, but how will you know if the web scraper you need is the one you got? Here are the factors you need to pay attention to understand this: The web scraper you want to use needs to be reconfigurable according to your web scraping needs. So if you are going to work on a big project for a short time and then start a lower project, the web scraper you will use needs to be able to adapt to it, so scalability is one of the most important criteria for a web scraper. You need to make sure that the price of the web scraper you want to use or rent is told to you in a completely transparent manner. If the fee communicated to you is not a completely transparent fee, you may encounter hidden costs later on and you may pay more than you planned to pay in this way. To avoid such a problem, make sure that the web scraper you pay for has a completely transparent pricing policy. It would be best to choose a web scraper company that has a completely clear price policy. You need to know whether the web scraper you prefer can deliver in the data format you need to be delivered. For example, if you need data in JSON format, the web scraper you want to import must be able to store data in JSON format. Also, to develop a secure web scraping process, it is very important to choose a web scraper that can store your data in multiple formats. A web scraper must be able to deliver data in XML, JSON, and CSV formats. If you are going to scrape data on the Internet, one of the most important things you need to know is that there is software that will prevent you from scraping data on the Internet. If you are going to try to scrape a website that has software that will prevent data scraping, you should make sure that the data scraper you choose can overcome these obstacles. It is very important to have a support team you can contact if you encounter any problems while operating your web scraper and need any assistance in resolving this issue. As you know, if you can’t use a web scraper properly, it’s not worth hiring that web scraper, so if you decide to buy a web scraper, make sure that web scraper has a customer support team. Since most of the data found on websites are unexamined and not categorized in a specific way, the data needs to be cleaned and organized by a web scraper before this information can be used. You will have made the most logical choice if you choose a web scraper that you are sure of the quality of the data you obtain and that it will be of use to you.

Just write to us for more information! What is Web Scraping? Fully automated web scraping, which is used to extract large-scale data from websites, is an essential and frequently used method of collecting data that can then be used in various applications. While there are multiple ways of scraping data that you can use to extract data from websites, it would make the most sense to use a web scraper for web scraping. ‍ Working Principle of Web Scrapers Web scrapers commissioned to scrape data from the Internet need the URL addresses of that website to scrape a website. It will then load an HTML code for all the sites it receives URL addresses from. If the web scraper you are using is more advanced, it is possible that these websites can also extract CSS and Javascript elements. After these elements are removed, the web scraper takes all the necessary data and rearranges it in the format the user wants, this format is usually Excel or CSV, although files such as JSON can also be used. Why Should You Use Web Scraping? Web scraping, which allows you to access the data on any website and see the data you reach on a regular basis, is a method you should use in many ways. We’ve put together a list of reasons why you should use web scraping for you. While you would normally be able to access individual data from all websites, using web scraping you can access data from any website you want with just a few clicks. Compared to other services on the market, web scraping is more affordable and budget-friendly, but keep in mind that pricing may vary depending on the features of your preferred web scraper. While you can scrape any website manually, it can be difficult to find data from various websites. You can access all this data in an organized way by using the web scraping service. When you start using any technology, you know that the technology you buy will have maintenance, installation, and many more costs. However, using a web scraper will not cost you any additional fees, and it is very unlikely that it will even require maintenance. For this reason, it is a budget-friendly and very useful technology in the long run. When you try to do web scraping without web scraping tools, it may take you weeks to collect data from various websites. But if you use a web scraper, a scraping project that would take weeks can be completed in just a few hours. It makes the most sense to use a web scraper that extracts data completely accurately, as accessing the right information is essential to web scraping and can lead to a lot of mistakes when people do it themselves. Data can be easily collected with web scraper software, where people working in your company do not need to copy or paste the data. Thanks to the easy collection of data and no need for workers during this process, your employees can engage in more creative work. Most Used Areas of Web Scraping If you have decided to use a web scraper but are not sure whether the area you are going to use is suitable for web scraping, you can take a look at these areas where web scraping is used most often. You can use web scraping to attract potential customers and make people aware of your products. You can easily access people’s contact information with web scraping and contact them. Since there is serious market competition between companies that offer the same products or services, these companies should follow each other and make price comparisons. You can also use web scraping to benefit from the data of products on websites such as Amazon, eBay. By accessing prices, descriptions, images, reviews, and ratings, you can more logically sell products on your website. You can use web scraping software to scrape owner contact information in addition to property information found on real estate sites. You can also use a web scraper to scrape and organize this data, as the information of websites in a certain category may be in different formats. You can use a web scraper for academic research on any subject. You can also scrape data to test models you use for machine learning or to augment machine learning. Although it is not a frequently used field, a web scraper can be used to collect the values ​​of the odds in sports betting. It is possible to scrape hotel and restaurant ratings and reviews from websites by using web scraping software. You can also access hotel room information and details in these hotels. Web Scraping Challenges Although web scraping may seem quite easy, there are many difficulties that can be encountered during this process. While some of these challenges can be overcome by your web scraper software, it’s worth learning about them. If you are aiming to extract large amounts of data, you need to know that this data extraction will generate large amounts of information, and you need to make your data warehouse fault-tolerant, scalable, secure, and highly available. If your data warehouse has stability or accessibility issues, your warehouse will accumulate additional overhead in searches and data filtering operations. Data scraping over the Internet is usually performed based on the user interface and structure, such as CSS and Xpath. If the website you want to scrape has made a few adjustments, it is possible for your scraper to crash completely or give random data in a way you don’t want. Maintaining scrapers is much more challenging than writing a new scraper, as this scenario is quite common. Since scraping data from websites is an increasingly common strategy these days, the servers of websites can take some measures to prevent data scraping. These measures are anti-scraping technologies and if you are constantly visiting a website from the same IP address, the website may block your IP address and cause you to be unable to access that site. Extracting data from websites that use software such as Javascript and Ajax to create dynamic content is much more difficult. This is because Ajax calls and Javascript are executed at runtime. Some websites have honeypot traps for detecting web scrapers you use to scrape the web. It is very difficult for the web scraper to scrape this data, as many of the link addresses are in a color that can mix with the background color or it is possible to turn off the display feature with CSS, but we can say that this method is not used often. Web scraping is frequently used today, as artificial intelligence and machine learning are of high interest and these technologies need large-scale data. However, since a single wrong data can cause serious problems in these projects, it is also very important that the data is scrapped correctly and has integrity. The larger a website is, the longer it will take to scrape that website. This should not upset you if your purpose of browsing the website you want to scrape is not a time-sensitive one, but most of the time-sensitive data on websites are needed. Time-sensitive data such as sales listings, currency rates, media trends, stocks, and market prices will constantly change. Captcha software, which is used to keep scraper software such as web scrapers away from a website, is frequently used by many websites, so you need a mechanism to stay away from this software. It is not possible to use a single machine for web scraping as web scraping is not used for scraping a single website on the internet and the more data the more efficiency. Best Practices for Web Scraping We have mentioned in many previous sub-headings that you may encounter many problems while doing web scraping. Now, we will briefly but concisely talk about the methods you can use to avoid these problems. Learn About the Target Website’s Robots.txt File The Robots.txt file, which informs the search engine robots of websites on how to crawl and index websites on their pages, is a very important text file containing instructions for crawlers. Before starting the data extraction process for any website, you should check the Robots.txt file that you can find in the website administrator section of that website. Don’t Send Requests to Servers Frequently Since the servers of the websites have a certain frequency range, the requests you send for a website should not be too frequent. If you have a fixed speed range since there will be a large amount of traffic on the website’s server, this website’s server may crash and all your requests may be unanswered. For this reason, you need to send requests according to the interval in the robots.txt file or with an interval of ten seconds. You Should Change User Agent Frequently Since every request consists of a user-agent string, and these strings reveal the browser you are using, your browser version, and the platform, if you use the same user-agent for every request, it can be easier for the website to understand that the request came from a particular browser. For this reason, try to change the user and caller on every request to avoid this problem. Change IP Addresses and Proxy Services Frequently If your IP addresses and proxy services do not change frequently, it will always be the most logical to use returning IP addresses and proxy services, as your requests will be visible and it can be understood from which browser they came. Make Your Scrapers Do Human Actions Since websites use anti-scraping technologies, if your website scrapers run a scan following the same pattern, these crawls will be easy for them to detect. You should make sure that your web scraper does actions such as mouse movements and random link clicks, as normally a person does not browse every website in the same order. Take Responsibility for the Data You Scrape You could face serious legal issues whenever data you scrape from a website is republished in any way, as it could be considered a violation of copyright laws. For this reason, before you scrape a website, you may need to check the terms of service page of that website. If you are looking for a budget-friendly scraper that can easily overcome the difficulties of web scraping and can be used in many areas, we at Scrape.do are here for you! We do our best for you to get the most out of the web scraping strategy, we are there for you in all your problems and we try our best to solve the problems.

For detailed information, you can examine our website and reach us through our communication channels. Now let’s move on to our article with your permission. What is Web Scraping? Web scraping or web harvesting is the process of scraping necessary information and data from websites on the World Wide Web using various programs, extensions, and codes. Today’s world is increasingly digital, and many for-profit businesses scrape data from the web for various purposes. Unlike manually extracting data, web scraping is ideal for scraping millions or even billions of data much more quickly and reliably. Some of the things that can be done with the web scraping method are competitor analysis, price monitoring for dynamic pricing, outsourcing data for the financial sector, and sentiment analysis to see the perception of the business, and we can say. In this article, we will talk about the place and importance of web scraping in the cryptocurrency industry. Learn web scraping better. Scrape Transaction: What is its Place in Cryptocurrency Trading? Cryptocurrencies, the biggest financial trend of recent years, continue to increase their popularity. Therefore, many people are attracted to the crypto money world and want to invest and make a fortune. However, some people make very high profits, while others make high losses. If you are also interested in cryptocurrencies and want to invest, you should do comprehensive market research in order not to lose. Big investors in the cryptocurrency exchange often take advantage of technology without taking any chances when it comes to market research. Because the error rate of various computer programs is so low that it cannot be compared with us humans. Moreover, they can perform analysis processes much faster than a human. With web scraping technology, you can extract historical cryptocurrency market data. There are several ways to extract this data. Among these methods, the most useful method is web scraping. If you intend to use this method, you should choose the web scraping method that you think will work best for you and deal with it. After choosing the suitable web scraping tool for you, you can perform all the remaining operations on your own, or you can get support from various experts. It is a frequently preferred method to graph the data obtained by web scraping. Because reading graphs is easier than reading data. After graphing the data, you will see that you will encounter constant ups and downs, in some cases, hard ups and downs, maybe bear or bull markets. In general, cryptocurrencies have much more animated graphics than exchange rates. Cryptocurrencies may be in a sharper decline or rise. Based on the chart you have obtained; you can determine whether you want to invest or not. Another advantage of web scraping technology in this area is that it allows investors to monitor prices. You can instantly monitor and react to pricing changes in cryptocurrencies with web scraping. In fact, you can automatically buy and sell cryptocurrencies according to the market movements according to the commands you give through some programs. The fact that such programs do these things through web scraping helps us understand how important web scraping technology is. Thanks to such instant trades, you may have narrowly avoided a great loss before you realize it, so to speak, and perhaps you may have made huge profits. Although these rises and falls can be based on various reasons, very hard breaks can occur. Although the reasons for these sharp declines and rises are sometimes very serious things, sometimes unexpected things can also affect the crypto money market. To give an example, Dogecoin experienced a very sharp rise after Elon Musk talked about it on social media. However, it fell sharply when markets discovered it was expensive. While the economy is already unpredictable, it is absolutely impossible to foresee that any of the cryptocurrencies, a concept that has just entered our lives, will rise with incredible momentum as a result of simple social media sharing. If the risk has been taken by investing in such obscurity, getting help from technologies such as web scraping will minimize your risk.

Remember we are here for you if you have any questions! Are you ready to learn what price scraping is and get detailed information about Residential Proxies? What is a Proxy? Proxies, which are a tool that allows you to pass through another channel to the website you want to log in to, are also called proxy servers or intermediate servers. When you connect to the Internet and log into the Internet online, you are tracked by all the websites you visit. You can be tracked not only by websites but also by your internet service provider. Due to this tracking, your IP address becomes a collection of numbers that show your behavior to the internet service provider and websites. So much so that with this IP address, it is even possible to reach your home address. Since using a proxy will hide your IP address, you will not compromise your privacy while surfing the internet. What Does Proxy Do and Why Is It Used? As an internet user, under normal conditions, you have to log in to the internet browser and type the URL link of the website you want to enter in the address section of the internet browser and press the Enter key. However, if you are using a proxy server, instead of typing the address of the website you want to enter into your internet browser, if you write to the website that provides proxy service, the proxy server of that website will enter that page and show you the content of the page completely correctly. In other words, you do not use your IP address to reach the website, but the IP address of the proxy server. In this way, you will have a secure and fast connection as you will completely hide your IP address. ‍ Using a proxy has many benefits, such as increasing the speed of accessing resources, ensuring the correct connection for internet use, ensuring your internal system security, preventing malware and viruses, and providing support for private security control. Internet users frequently use proxy servers, as it becomes possible to access websites that are banned or blocked in your region by using proxy servers. If you want to make your internet access more free and secure, you should definitely try using a proxy. Although proxy servers are generally used to log into prohibited websites, these servers are also used to have fast internet by many companies that find their internet servers insufficient. It is a well-known fact that many famous companies prefer Proxy servers to protect company data. In addition, proxies are also used to protect from advertisements, scams, frauds, data leaks, and such bad situations that can lead to negative consequences. What are Proxy Types? Proxy types available in the market are Data Center Proxies, Distorting Proxies, Rotating Proxies, Anonymous Proxies and Residential Proxies. Let’s take a brief look at these Proxy types one by one, as these Proxy types have their own specific uses: Data Center Proxies Data Center Proxies, which are known for their speed and whose most important feature is their speed, are Proxies that look like a Proxy working with the cloud. This type of Proxy is not strictly dependent on real devices and they use IP addresses generated virtually by the computer. Distorting Proxies With Distorting Proxies, which deliberately uses wrong IP addresses in login requests to websites, you appear to be logging into the website over a different geographical location, so you can easily log in to geographically blocked websites. Rotating Proxies These proxies are proxies that provide a high level of security and privacy, as you will have a new IP address with your request every time you request to access the website. Anonymous Proxies If you do not want the house you live in or the location you are currently in to appear when logging into a website, you need to use Anonymous Proxies. These Proxy types do not transmit your IP address to the websites you log in to, and they allow you to get rid of the ads of the websites that target you. Residential Proxies You can choose to connect from any region you want with Residential Proxies, which automatically assigns you the IP address of a physical mobile device or a desktop device. These proxies, which allow you to choose the country, city, or mobile operator you want, help you browse the internet as if you are a real person living in that region. What Does Web Scraping and Web Scraper Mean? Web scraping, which is usually an automated process aimed at extracting data from websites, is a strategy that can be easily used by humans and can also be done manually. Although it seems that the automatic method is always used, it is seen that some companies do this manually. This way of web scraping is strongly discouraged, as using web scraping manually would be a completely slow and inefficient option. It is a more common method to use special software developed for web scraping and extract the data through this software, rather than doing web scraping manually. Web scrapers, which are used to scrape data from websites and categorize the scraped data in a certain way, can examine thousands of websites within a few hours to obtain the information you want and store the information you want in a specific location. These softwares, which perform the process that a person should spend hundreds of hours in just a few hours, are also programmed to store the data they obtain in an easily analyzable way. That is, the data obtained by web scrapers is stored in a database or in a spreadsheet that can also be viewed offline. This stored information can then be used by the person who wants to store the data. What Does Price Scraping Mean? Price scraping, which is based on extracting price information from the internet using software or a web browser, is very important for the development of an e-commerce site. The software used for this process must search, find and copy the data regarding the price information on the predetermined websites to another file. The main purpose of this process is to create an accurate pricing policy by reviewing the data of the websites dealing with e-commerce. Many websites are aware of this process and use anti-scraping tools to prevent prices and all data from being scraped, making it difficult to scrape e-commerce sites. Since these anti-scratch tools can mistake real people for bots, this process is getting more difficult every day. How Do You Scrape the Prices of Competitor E-commerce Sites? If you plan to scrape prices on certain websites and want to realign your pricing policy to those of other companies, the first step is to find out who your competitors are. For example, if you are a company that aims to sell products at affordable prices, websites with designer products are not your competitors, and scraping these websites would be a waste of time. Instead, if you find e-commerce sites that make sales for the same purpose as you and scrape the price information of these websites, it will make more sense for you. Once you have found out who these websites, i.e. your competitors, are, you can start data scraping. ‍If you intend to scrape data containing price information from websites, remember that your team must have a person with expertise in this subject. If there is no such person in your team, you can get help from a person who is an expert in this field or a freelancer. You should make sure that the person you prefer has the knowledge to run software that can scrape data from competing websites. After you have the data obtained by this person who is an expert in the technical field, you can apply a pricing policy where you can regulate your prices according to the prices of other companies in order to compete with rival companies. You can command software for data scraping to scan price information only once, then order that data to be processed into a spreadsheet. However, you should not forget that the price information you have maybe the data before the rival companies change the prices. Let’s reinforce this with an example so you can understand it better. Let’s say you did a price scan in February, you reached the prices of competing websites with this price scan and rearranged your prices according to these websites, maybe you increased the prices. However, contrary to what you thought and planned, there was a serious decrease in product sales. The reason for this may be that other websites have reduced prices in March. For this reason, you need to repeat the price research you will do at certain intervals and reach static data. Price Scraping by Residential Proxy Script The usually recommended Proxy type for price scraping for your e-commerce site is Residential Proxy. If you do not want the website where you will use price scraping data to be understood and your IP address to be detected, the first Proxy type you should choose for security and reliability is Residential Proxy. Datacenter Proxies are also often used for price scraping and although they are faster, these Proxy types are not recommended for price scraping as they do not give you serious security. You will not compromise your anonymity when you use Residence Proxies, but your speed will slow down, however, it doesn’t matter how fast a proxy server you have as long as you are not anonymous.

How about contacting us to learn more? What is Web Scraping? You can save the raw data extracted by web scraping, which is the process of extracting large amounts of raw data from websites, to a file on your computer or access it from a spreadsheet. When you log in to any page on a website, you can only see the data on that site, it is not possible to download that data. This download does not include copying and pasting data from the website into another file, as this method takes unnecessary time and you cannot scale the data you obtain with this method. By using web scrapers instead of manually copying and pasting, you can automate this whole process and access the accurate, necessary data in a short time. There is no specific limit to the amount and type of data you scrape with web scraping. The data you want to scrape can be text documents, images, email addresses, users’ phone numbers, and more. It is also possible for you to use the data scraping method for specific projects. For example, if you are going into the real estate business, you can scrape financial data and real estate data. After the web scraping is done, you will get the data you want in an organized way in the text, JSON, or CSV format, in a human-interpretable way. How Step-by-Step Web Scraping Works Web scraping is one of the most commonly used development methods in the internet environment. While there are many ideas about how this method works, we will give you a simple overview of how it works. We can summarize the steps of web scraping as follows: If you have started using a web scraper, your first step will be to submit a request on that website to be able to access data on that website. After this request, your web scraper reaches the data you want to obtain in HTML format. As a second step, your web scraper is expected to perform parsing and extraction. HTML, a markup language used for texts, is parsed at this stage. Parsing HTML starts with having the HTML code. After this start, your web scraper will extract data from the page such as headings, paragraphs, subheadings, links, and text in bold. The third step is based on downloading and saving the data you have obtained. The data you obtain is downloaded in CSV, JSON, or any format and saved in a location of your choice. After this stage, you can access the data whenever you want and use the data you obtain as you wish. You can even store this data in a central local database or export all of the data to a spreadsheet to analyze the data. What are the Advantages of Web Scraping? Web scraping is a very advantageous method as it is cost-effective, requires very little maintenance, is fast, easy to implement, and provides accurate data. Web Scraping Is More Cost-Effective With the web scraping strategy, which is one of the best methods you can use if you want to get better service at an affordable price, you have the opportunity to grow your business while reducing the costs of your business. It is necessary to obtain the data on the websites and analyze this data regularly, but if you make this system by copying and pasting, it will take your time and may cause a decrease in your earnings. If you use web scraping services as a data acquisition method, you can both benefit from this service at a more affordable price and obtain data faster. Web Scraping Method Doesn’t Require Too Frequent Maintenance It is a known fact that software and programs that are customized for certain marketing strategies need constant maintenance. If you use the web scraping strategy and make use of web scrapers during this use, your maintenance frequency will decrease and your maintenance costs will be very low. Thanks to this low maintenance fee, you can plan your budget correctly and increase your income. The Data You Extract With Web Scraping is Mostly Accurate If you use manual methods while doing data extraction, you can make simple mistakes and these simple mistakes can cause big problems, so you need to access as many accurate data as you can. When you scrape any website with web scraping, you get completely accurate information about that site and you can interpret this information offline later. The Web Scraping Method is Quite Easy to Implement If you want to scrape any website with the web scraping method, running the web scraper properly and having the URL addresses of the websites you want to be scraped will be sufficient. In addition, you can get a large amount of data in a short time by making only a small investment. Is Web Scraping Possible on All Sites on the Internet? Many website owners do not allow people to scrape their websites, as web scraping can cause some websites’ servers to crash, which leads to speeding up website traffic. If you want to know which websites allow web scraping or not, just look at the website’s “robots.txt” file. If you put this file after the URL address of the data you want to download, you can find out if that website allows web scraping. What are the Difficulties Encountered While Web Scraping? We have explained in detail to you in what ways web scraping is easy and logical. Now, we’re going to tell you bit by bit how hard web scraping can be: Installing a web scraper to scrape a website doesn’t mean you’re done. As website owners constantly update the user interface and functions on their websites, they cause many structural changes. These structural changes can ruin all your plans because the code sequence of the website has been completely changed. HoneyPots, important mechanisms for detecting crawlers and scrapers, are used to protect websites that store sensitive and valuable information. These mechanisms take the form of hidden links that can hinder your web scraping efforts. Your IP address may be blocked or flagged as suspicious if detected by HoneyPots that you have scraped from the website. Websites like LinkedIn and Stubhub, which have sensitive user information and don’t want to deal with scraping, do not hesitate to use technologies that can prevent you from scraping. Anti-web scraping technologies developed to prevent bot access and block suspicious IP addresses can negatively affect your web scraping process. Finding a way to consistently get high-quality data is essential for your web scraping mechanisms to work and be more useful. If you get the wrong data at the end of the process, you may not know how successful your projects are and you may make wrong decisions about your projects. To avoid wrong decisions, you should make sure that your web scraping is getting the correct data. Web Scraping Methods You Can Try If Your Scraping Is Blocking In Any Way As we told you in one of the above topics, a website may not allow you to scrape it when it doesn’t want you to access that server’s data or because it thinks the web server might be damaged. In fact, if your IP address is detected, it can be marked as suspicious or you can be blocked from entering the website by banning it completely. If you want to continue scraping websites without any restrictions, use these methods: Constantly Change Your IP Address If you automate your HTTPS requests, you will send repeated requests from the same IP address and cause your requests to be marked as suspicious. You should know that website owners can easily block the access of IP addresses in log files, so you cannot log in to that website. Although there are website owners who do this manually, this is usually done automatically and the number of requests you can send within an hour is limited. If you do not want to be blocked from websites while scraping a website, you can take advantage of proxy servers or virtual private network providers as you will need to send your requests through many different IP addresses. Since both proxy servers and virtual private networks will hide your real IP address, you will be able to scrape all websites without any problems. Change Referrer Header Frequently Referrer header, which means the title of the website you use to reach that website before you enter the website you want, is also mentioned in the resources as a request header. In other words, if you log in to a website from https://www.google.com , you will appear as if you have logged into this website from the Google search engine of America. If you constantly change this referrer title, the text of the requests you will send will also change because you will be logging in from different websites, so your requests will not appear to come from the same link. Take Web Scraping as Long as Possible We all know that web scrapers can scrape data faster than a human can, which speed is sometimes a helpful factor but sometimes quite detrimental. Since it normally takes a long time for a person to navigate on a website, briefly looking at the internet pages and exiting can show the website owners that you are doing bot transactions. How fast you scroll through the pages, how long it takes to change a page, how fast you scroll the pages, and how quickly you interact with the pages is very important for your web scraper to stay undetected. You can command your web scraper to perform slow operations like a human. Leverage Random Sleep Delays and Random Actions So Your Web Scraper Is Not Detected If you want to scrape websites with a web scraper, the websites must not know that you are using a web scraper. A logical solution would be to add random sleep delays to your web scraper to give the impression that a human is using it and a human is browsing the website. Also, since people click on pages randomly, your web scraper needs to randomly click on elements on the page, for which you can add random actions. Give the Impression of a Human Using Different Scraping Patterns We have explained in the previous sub-headings that people’s browsing activity occurs at a slow pace, and we can easily say that people review websites differently and completely different from web scrapers. When people log into a website, they may click randomly or wait longer than usual in some sections. Since web scrapers and bots follow the same patterns, these repetitive behaviors increase the visibility of web scrapers and bots, meaning they can be easily spotted by websites. To avoid this situation, you should design your scraping models in different ways, for example, your web scraper should click on random places. This is because many sites have advanced anti-web scraping technologies and bots can easily detect actions. If you want your web scraper to look like a human, consider adding the following activities to your web scraper software: Randomly scrolling down the website Taking breaks that real people would take, such as toilet breaks and lunch breaks. Commenting under a piece of news or a user’s post. Reacting to any news or user content. Watching videos on websites. Perform Web Scraping at Different Times If you are sure that your web scraper will perform random actions, you should also consider adding software to log in to the same website at different times, as this will hide your footprint if you log into a website at different times. For example, if you are constantly logging into a website at 2 pm, choose to log in at 9 am on some days and at night on some days. That way your web scraper will be able to follow a random timeline. Detect Changes Made by Websites to Codes Immediately Although every website has its own unique layout and theme, it is possible that website owners will decide to redesign this layout. If your web scraper is trying to scrape in accordance with the previous layout and the website has switched to a new layout, your web scrapers will not work. If you want to detect changes in websites and want to make sure that your web scraper is still working, you need to find a solution. You will be satisfied with your web scraping results with this method which will make the majority of per-scrape requests successful on the internet and help you to constantly monitor the changes in the websites.

While web scraping , a strategy for extracting large amounts of interpretable data from websites, can be done manually, it is more sensible to do it automatically. Most of the data obtained by this method is saved in spreadsheets or a file in any format so that it can be interpreted later. There are multiple methods you can use to scrape data from websites. If we talk about these methods, we can briefly say online web scraper services, using certain APIs and writing code for web scraping. Although you can access structured data on large websites using the API, many websites do have unstructured data. You should consider using web scraper services for data on all websites, as it would be most logical to use a web scraper to access data on these websites with a lot of unstructured data. What is Required for Web Scraping? If you want to scrape data from a website and save it to a file for later reinterpretation, you will need certain hardware and software. We can also say that web scraping basically needs two different parts, the browser and the scraper. The browser’s job is to browse the web to monitor URL links and search for data when needed. A web scraper, on the other hand, is responsible for extracting data from websites accessed by the browser as quickly and accurately as possible. Let us also tell you that the web scrapers you use can vary depending on the size and importance of your project. How Web Scrapers Work It is highly recommended to create a URL link list if you want web scrapers tasked with extracting all data from predetermined websites or specific data on a user’s desired topics to work better, you should also specify what the data is. Let us explain this situation with an example. You’re a sterling silver necklace business and want to scrape data from an Amazon page for reviews, but if what you want is customer reviews and you don’t want product information, specifying it will help speed up your web scraper. As we explained in the paragraph above, the URL addresses of the website to be scraped are listed first before a website starts to be scraped. Immediately after, your web scraper will load all the HTML codes of these websites, if you have an advanced web scraper, it is also possible for your scraper to load CSS and JavaScript codes. After this installation, your web scraper obtains the information you want from the codes in HTML or other software languages ​​and saves it in a file in another format. The saved file must be viewable offline and user interpretable. What Are the Types of Web Scraper? Web scrapers can be classified into six groups namely Self-Building Web Scrapers, Pre-built Web Scrapers, Browser Extension Scrapers, Software Web Scrapers, Cloud Web Scrapers, and Native Web Scrapers. Let’s take a look at these web scrapers item by item: If you have advanced programming knowledge to write it yourself, you can have Self-Building Web Scrapers. So you can write software to create a web scraper. If you want extra features in the web scraper you will create, you should start developing your knowledge. Prebuilt Web Scrapers are web scrapers available on the internet that you can easily download and run. These scrapers also have some features that you can customize. Web Scrapers with Browser Extension, which are added to your browser and can be run with a small button, are very limited, although they are easy to use scrapers. In other words, it can extract the data on the page it is in, but cannot extract the data on a different website. Let’s also add that web scrapers with this structure do not have many advanced features. Software Web Scrapers are one of the essential web scrapers that you can download and install on your computer. Since these scrapers are integrated with your computer, they can not only scrape any website you want but also scrape multiple websites at the same time. However, let’s also say that this type of web scraper has a more complex use than other web scrapers. Cloud-Based Web Scrapers, which you can easily obtain from websites that sell or rent web scrapers on the Internet, work over an off-site server and this server is generally called the cloud. We can unequivocally say that these web scrapers do not take advantage of computer resources. Normally you cannot do anything while your computer is dealing with web scraping, but if you use Cloud Based Web Scrapers you can also use your computer while web scraping because Cloud Web Scrapers do not use your computer hardware. Native Web Scrapers, unlike Cloud-Based Web Scrapers, are web scrapers that work integrated into your computer and these web scrapers can prevent you from taking action on your computer. If the web scraper you are using requires too much CPU and RAM, you will not be able to do the things you want to do on your computer. Local Web Scrapers are not a very popular idea, as this can negatively affect your computer and shorten its lifespan. ‍ ‍ Why Should You Use Web Scraping? With web scraping, you can automatically obtain data, monitor competitors and have insights about competitors, have unique and rich datasets, organize the data you obtain effectively. Let’s take a closer look at these advantages: You Can Automatically Extract Data Using Web Scrapers If you are using a properly working web scraper, you can automatically scrape data from websites you want and save this data to a file for later interpretation. This automated process will make both you and your colleagues’ work time more efficient, meaning you’ll be able to engage in more creative work rather than hours of data collection.

How Are Websites Protected From Web Scrapers? Many websites use anti-web scraping technologies because some of the web scrapers are malicious, can slow down websites by making high requests to websites, and damage websites’ servers. However, most of these technologies have become ineffective because the scrapers have not kept up with the evolving technology. For example, we can say that some web scrapers disguise themselves as humans. There are some methods that a website uses to protect it from web scraping, and these methods can be described as follows: When web-scraping is done, thousands of requests are usually sent from a single computer, if the number of requests sent to your website is higher than what would normally happen, there is a good chance that the requests are being made automatically. If it is understood that the number of requests from a computer is higher than normal, the access of that computer to the website can be blocked, and the methods of preventing access are IP ban or marking the IP address as suspicious. In the HTTP protocol, which is a stateless protocol by nature, requests will provide completely accurate information to the IP address to which they are sent. So if you are using the HTTP protocol, the data on your website is scrapable for web scraping, there is no encryption involved. Some websites use login-required software to detect and block scrapers. While the maintenance fees of web scrapers are not expensive, web scrapers do not change very often, meaning that whenever a website changes, the web scraper becomes unable to scrape that content. For this, many websites constantly change the HTML code that the website has and thus prevent web scraping. What Are Web Scrapers Used For? You can use web scrapers to scrape data from the internet to prepare property listings, browse industry statistics and make predictions based on statistics, compare shopping sites, generate leads, analyze data, do academic research. Let’s take a look at what web scraping does in these areas: Many people and real estate agents working in the real estate industry can use web scraping to obtain information about properties to be sold or leased and to store this information in a database. Property descriptions, which you can easily find on real estate sites, are data obtained by real estate companies by web scraping. All companies that aim to grow more and want to work on this need sector statistics and predictions about the events in the sector. Web scraping is used to get insights and statistics for this industry. Since the number of people shopping online and the number of businesses selling online is increasing day by day, there are too many of the same products in the market, and the prices of the products are almost unique. In this case, if you want to buy and sell products at a more affordable price, you should compare shopping sites, and you can easily do this with web scraping. Lead generation, which is a very popular web scraping use case, is a method for generating leads. To put it briefly, many companies access user data from the internet and communicate directly with these users and try to persuade users to buy products from their companies. If you want to extract data from any website in any domain and analyze that data by seeing it in a spreadsheet, you should use web scraping. With web scraping, which is one of the best ways to access data in any field you want, you will have more data than you could ever imagine.While web scraping is often used to scrape prices from websites, many people who conduct large research prefer to do academic research and save time with web scraping.

Unstructured data appears as HTML, with its long name HyperText Markup Language, while structured data appears in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats. While interpreting HTML data is easy for a computer, it is not easy for a human, so the data in HTML format needs to be converted to another format and made interpretable. ‍ Working Principle of Web Scraping Working as a human reading different pages of different websites and copying all the content on those pages into a file in another format, web scraping can actually categorize the information you want into a table. When you run web scrapers used for web scraping, they first send a request to the server where the website is located, and data is obtained in response to this request. The web scrapers that obtain this data will get the data you want and create a table of contents by deleting the other data if you have edited it. If you have not made any edits, you will have to edit the data you have obtained yourself. Learn More How web scraping can help your eCommerce business!

Although it has taken a serious leap, internet sales activities will grow even more with the further development of the internet. It is quite easy for the eyes to enter this market, which has a huge potential. It is quite easy to transform your website into an e-commerce site that sells products on the internet, but since there are many e-commerce websites, newly opened websites do not have much luck in the market. If you are an e-commerce entrepreneur who has just entered the market, you should not forget that you must monitor and follow your competitors. Using the web scraping method, you can easily find the following information about your competitors: If you have found out who the competitor websites are, you can get information about new products by scraping the product information on these websites or you can learn the marketing strategies used by those websites.

By scraping the social media accounts of rival companies, you can find out what kind of audience they have, and you can gain customers by contacting people who can be your customers from their customers. You Can Scrape Other Companies’ Prices to Follow an Accurate Pricing Strategy for Your Products Many newly opened e-commerce site owners have no idea how much they will sell their products for. The prices on your website should be at a level where you won’t lose your customers and that you can get the highest profit you can consistently get. Although people who shop online generally prefer cheaper products, it is a well-known fact that they pay more for higher quality products. If you think your products are of good quality and still cannot sell enough, you can start by scraping the prices of competitors.

Here is how web scraping works for price scraping and what it does: By scraping the information of your customers and the customers of the competitor company, you can learn the interests of your potential customers and follow a marketing strategy according to the interests of your customers. Once you know your customers’ interests and the amount they spend on their interests, you need to make a good assessment. If your customers are not afraid to spend a lot of money on a product, you can make small price increases. However, if your customers are the types who do not like to spend money, you can encourage them to shop by organizing campaigns.

There are investment strategies that range from constructing a hypothetical thesis to experimenting, doing research, and monitoring and analyzing the results, and these strategies need extensive research. If you have decided to make an investment and you want to decide whether the investment method you will apply is the right one, you need to know what kind of data that investment has in the past. You should learn the reasons for the failures and successes that investment has had in the past, learn about the pitfalls you can fall into, and have a clear understanding of the return on investment you plan to achieve. In order to do this, you can apply the data scraping method to the investment you will make, and you can make more accurate decisions by having a wider perspective on the data you obtain. What Will the Future of Data Scraping Be Like? Although it is up to you to decide whether to use data scraping for a study or not, it is possible to say that data scraping will be of incredible importance in the next few years. It is very important that you learn data scraping soon, which will be of great importance, and train yourself to be able to scrape data, otherwise, you will fall far behind in the market. Even now, there is artificial intelligence software on the market that has the ability of people to interpret images and can translate visually entered information into written form. These softwares interpret the data they obtain and use it for machine learning purposes. Although we all know the advances in data scraping in writing, systems that can only scrape data from images and videos will be developed in the future. As we develop in the field of image scraping, even if we are not looking at the images, we will be able to learn about images and apply many strategies more accurately, thanks to the data we obtain. What Steps Should You Follow Before Scraping a Website? We all know that after scraping a website, we have to examine the data make comments about our website, and even create marketing strategies to improve our e-commerce site. But do you know what to do before you do data scraping? Let’s take a look at what you need to do before scraping data. Step One: Think Like a Machine, Not a Human Websites, which basically consist of a mixture of HTML codes, can be formed both statically and dynamically, and each website of each website has specific HTML codes for that page. It always makes more sense to use a web scraper to scrape a website, as web scrapers are tools that can convert raw data written in HTML into formats such as JSON and CSV. You also need to press a single button in your web scraping app to run the web scraper. Although web scrapers are customized for web scraping, you should keep in mind that dynamic websites can change at any time and your web scraper will not be able to access the correct data every time you run it. This may be because your web scraper has software that cannot tell what changes have taken place on the website. As a human you can get the data on the website and rearrange the data, it would make the most sense to use a web scraper that can handle this issue as these changes can take several hours. Step Two: Set Up Your Web Scraper This step is actually a pretty easy one, basically. If you have chosen the web scraper you want to use and this web scraper has a good service team, you can easily set up your web scraper with the help of the service team. However, you will install a web scraper that you download from the internet, and you will need to get detailed information on how to install that web scraper. Step Three: Submit URL Request to Website You Want to Scrape If you are sure that you have successfully set up your web scraper correctly, you are entitled to the step of sending a URL request to the website you want to scrape. Note that if a URL request is not sent, your data will not be downloaded and saved. Also, be sure to delete your cookies, internet search history, and cached data before sending any URL request. Step Four: Don’t Repeat Your URL Requests If you want to scrape data from a website, don’t send multiple requests or send too many requests to the same website address to get the data you want. If you are logging into a website that can access your IP address, your requests will appear and your IP address will be blocked. Step Five: Make Web Scraping As Slow as Possible We can easily say that the faster you do web scraping, the worse results you will get. If you want to scrape a website, you should select a few pages as possible and scan these web pages. After scanning, you need to add libraries and then re-request a small number of web pages. Step Six: Download All the Data You Want to Get If you have scraped the data, it means you can start downloading all the data of the previously scraped URL addresses. Your web scraper will automatically download all data from websites and create a structured dataset from unstructured data. Step Seven: Divide All the Data You Have into Smaller Pieces If you organize the data you have in small groups, you can draw a new and easy way for yourself. In other words, by dividing a website into two stages, you can collect the URL links of the websites in the first stage, and download the data on the websites in the second stage. Step Eight: Create a URL List in case your Scraping Fails During the Process Keeping the URL lists that you will create for your scraper to scrape permanently will be useful in case you encounter a problem during the process. If your scraping was technically unsuccessful, you can restart the process using those URL addresses to download the rest. As Scrape.do , we are with you throughout your entire web scraping process, helping you to get the best data both during, before, and after the process. By using our web scraper that we have created for you, you can overcome the obstacles on all websites and create the right strategy to make your e-commerce store bigger than ever before.

We may divide proxies into two types based on how often their IP addresses change; rotating proxies and non-rotating or persistent IPs. Each of them has a specific application, which is determined by the requirements of the work at hand. We will talk about rotation proxies in this article of ours! Proxy servers may be divided into categories depending on a variety of factors. We may divide proxies into two types based on how often their IP addresses change: rotating proxies and non-rotating or persistent IPs. Each of them has a specific application, which is determined by the requirements of the work at hand. We will talk about rotation proxies in this article of ours! At Scrape.do we deeply care about rotating proxies and using them to your advantage! What Is a Rotating Proxy, And How Does It Work? A rotating proxy is a proxy server that sits between you and the websites you’re trying to access. Every time you submit a request, it assigns your machine a new IP address, which is how it works. If, for example, you are gathering large amounts of data from a variety of websites, you may visit the pages using many identities. All that is required is that you choose a service provider, get your IP addresses, and specify how often you would want the addresses to be changed. ‍ When it comes to enterprises, using many IP addresses to operate provides good anonymity. Rotating proxies are also useful for site crawling, scraping, and any other kind of research that helps to grow digital marketing campaigns. Even more impressive is the fact that distinct IP addresses might reflect different places. You will be able to sidestep the majority of regional constraints and open up more prospects for worldwide development in this manner. What Is the Procedure for an IP Rotation? IP rotation does a basic, but critical task: it allocates a fresh IP address to each and every connection. When sending hundreds of simultaneous connection requests, our server will cycle the IP addresses every time, allowing you to maximize your bandwidth. IP rotation elevates online scraping and site auditing to a higher degree of sophistication. It also safeguards you against subnet bans, which are a common occurrence with data center proxies. What Is the Purpose of Rotating Proxies? One important benefit of rotating proxies is that IP rotation is automated, so you don’t have to use as many of them to complete your online chores as you would otherwise. Crawling and scraping information from the web is best accomplished via the usage of rotating proxies.  Proxy servers that alter every request are not suitable for applications such as social media automation, sneaker copping, and other session-sensitive tasks. However, rotating proxies that retain sessions for an extended period may be utilized for these purposes. The purpose of rotating proxies ‍ The Reasons for Using a Rotating Proxy As we previously discussed, the major aim of rotating proxies is to conceal the identity of the user when online scraping. Second, they lessen the likelihood of being detected and blocked while web scraping is being carried out. Aside from this, there are several more advantages of employing Rotating proxy servers. Let’s take a look at some real-world scenarios and see how rotating proxies may be of tremendous assistance. Marketing using social media Because over half of the population has a social media account, social media marketing is a tremendously effective strategy. Every company is looking to increase sales and expand, so the competition on social media is becoming fiercer. In order to engage customers, one must maintain a constant publishing schedule and respond to followers’ comments. Using numerous social media accounts to manage this may be quite convenient, however, most platforms prohibit the usage of multiple social media accounts since it violates their terms of service. Rotating proxies may alleviate this problem by automatically changing the IP addresses, causing the server to believe that the connection is coming from a new place each time it receives it. Restriction on the Use of Content Although it is not widely used, several websites enforce IP rotations depending on a user’s location. Anyone attempting to access it from a certain location will be denied access. However, there is a solution to deal with this problem. Connecting to proxies located outside of the geo-restricted region will allow you to bypass the geo-block and obtain access to the restricted website. The use of rotating proxies will always be beneficial, whether you want to watch a film or a television program, read blogs, or access anything that is not permitted in your area at the time. Furthermore, since it will use a different IP address for every new connection, it will save you from being blacklisted. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) SEO, like social media marketing, is a critical topic to understand and use. SEO is a useful approach since it allows you to do the appropriate keyword research, rank well in search engines, optimize your website technically, and analyze your competitors. Site audits are often done on competitors’ websites in order to identify the keywords that are causing them to rank top in search results. A site audit is just a fancy phrase for online scraping and crawling, which is what we do every day. Performing a consistent site assessment might result in the IP address being blocked. A website has a large number of pages. The program must make hundreds of queries to the server in order to sift through all of them at the same time. The most logical method to do this is, of course, via the use of a rotating proxy. The use of a unique IP address for each request makes site audits very simple and thorough, regardless of how many pages need to be scraped or crawled. Crawling and Scraping Web scraping and crawling are popular techniques for gaining access to sectors and marketplaces and conducting in-depth analyses of them. Web crawling is used to index information on the internet, while web scraping is used to retrieve specific information from the internet. Most websites do not permit the use of any of these strategies. Despite this, people continue to do it. How? The basic strategy underlying this well-known notion, which is employed by many marketers and well-known scraping programs, is the usage of rotating proxies. The concept is simple: bots and scraper programs traverse the web using a variety of different IP addresses, minimizing the likelihood of being blocked from doing so. Advantages of Rotating Proxies Given the fact that rotating proxies are among the most sophisticated protocols available, using one has a number of significant advantages. The following are some of the most fundamental benefits that rotating proxies provide. ‍ ‍"},

In the vast majority of circumstances, web scrapers will export data to an Excel spreadsheet or a JSON file. By using a web scraper, you may effectively create an API for any data collection available on the internet.

Whenever you want information, you just Google it and go to the site that has the most appropriate response to your inquiry… You can access the information you want, but what if you require it to be saved locally? If you want to view the information on a hundred more pages, you’ll have to pay extra. The majority of websites available on the internet do not provide the opportunity to store the information contained within them to a local hard drive. Furthermore, when you have to store the data from hundreds (and occasionally thousands) of websites, this operation might seem to be quite time-consuming. It’s possible that you’ll wind up spending days just copying and pasting sections from several websites. Here’s where web scraping comes into play. It helps you save all of the necessary data with simplicity and in a short period of time by automating the process. This is accomplished via the use of web scraping software or web scraping methods by numerous specialists. What Is the Purpose of Web Scraping?

Web scraping is a method of collecting and categorizing all of the necessary data in a single easily accessible area.

Web scraping is as common in many businesses as data science is, and it is just as common in data science.

Alternatively, you may construct a website for the same purpose. Despite the large size of the market, there is a minimal rivalry. Due to the sheer volume of available sports data, different firms with differing goals may interpret it in a variety of ways to achieve their goals. Job Aggregators A job aggregator is a website that combines job posts from several websites into a single searchable online user interface that can be accessed from any computer. People use the internet to look for employment opportunities. Job searchers will benefit from having a website that is able to scrape job posts from career sites and other relevant sources.

In this article, we’ve covered the methods and resources you need to learn web scraping, as well as how to get started. When a person copies any piece of information from a website and saves it in another file, they have actually done what a regular web scraper would do. The biggest difference between manual copy-paste and automatic web scraping is that the manual process takes place on a smaller scale. When it comes to web scraping, intelligent and automated automation must be used to extract data from hundreds or even millions of data points. As one of the basic elements of web scraping, a web scraper loads multiple URL addresses and then ensures that the entire HTML code for these selected pages is loaded, so the process is extremely complicated. For websites that contain elements such as JavaScript and CSS, web scraping will become even more complex as a more advanced web scraper is required. Due to the complex nature of web scraping, web scraping is an extremely difficult skill to learn. If someone wants to learn web scraping well, they must first identify the right resources from which they can learn data science in an easy way. In this article, we’ve covered the methods and resources you need to learn web scraping, as well as how to get started. Web scraping is not something that an ordinary person can easily perform. In order to obtain properly designed, structured and accurate data in line with the web scraping project, it is necessary to be an expert in this field. We at Scrape.do offer you a web scraper tool created by our expert developers. Moreover, since your transaction takes place over the cloud, it will not use your internet or the power of your computer. Contact us to get the best service at the most affordable prices! What You Should Know Before You Start Learning Web Scraping There are web scrapers available in the form of browser extensions, software, or a cloud-based service that you can access over the Internet. It is quite natural that you do not have any information about which of these web scrapers you want to use and how to use them, there is no need to hesitate. In this section, we told you about the best web scraping libraries you can choose for your project: BeautifulSoup : BeautifulSoup, which is the easiest tool you can choose among the libraries and tools we mentioned in this section, also has some disadvantages. When you use BeautifulSoup, you must additionally use a request library to make requests to the website, and you must have a parser to extract data. Because of such features, code transfer between web scraping projects becomes extremely complex. Selenium : You do not need to use an extra parser like BeautifulSoup in Selenium, which also allows you to extract data from websites that use JavaScript to create dynamic content on the page. However, one of the most important disadvantages of Selenium is that it is an extremely slow library. The reason for this is that all the scripts on the website will be run and scanned. Learn also: The Components of Web Scraping How Should You Start Learning Web Scraping? Learning web scraping may seem extremely complicated as there are a lot of programming languages ​​and libraries you can learn, but it is also possible that you can learn it in an easier way. In this section, we’ve given you five different tips on how to get started learning web scraping the easiest. 1. Level Up Starting Easy If you have decided to create your first scraper to run a web scraping project, you should not lose your enthusiasm by trying to collect the most complex collections of data from the most complex web pages, but instead, you should start with simpler methods. There are also websites that are specially designed for people to learn web scraping more easily, you should make maximum use of these websites as the sole purpose of these websites is for people to practice. For example, Quotes.toscrape.com would be a good starting practice. However, you should not only use websites designed for web scraping, but after you have mastered the basics of the process, you should go after data that match your interests. If you go after websites that will interest you, you will feel motivated and will enable you to search for new solutions and approaches on your own. Whatever software language you use, as long as you follow this first recommendation, you will be extremely productive. In addition, this method will be extremely useful for you whether you use a programming language or not. If you want to get used to the basics of books like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, going very slowly will get better results. 2. Master BeautifulSoup If you are confident that you have learned the basics, have practiced enough, and have chosen the Python programming language, the next step should be to master the BeautifulSoup library. Mastering BeautifulSoup, a very powerful parsing tool with many different possibilities, can take a long time. After mastering this tool, you will know all the arguments in the find and find_all methods, the concept of parents, children, and siblings, and the attributes in HTML tags as well as an expert software engineer. You will also be able to learn some HTML knowledge after mastering BeautifulSoup. 3. Get Interested in JavaScript If you have followed the steps correctly and have mastered BeautifulSoup, there is no obstacle for you to scrape a lot of data now. However, when you eventually parse the HTML document on a page, you may encounter pages and content that are unexplainable. The most important reason for this is that some pages have been created in the JavaScript programming language that the libraries you have worked with so far cannot handle. At this stage, you will see Selenium. Preventing you from accessing all the content of the page because you’ve loaded everything, Selenium is actually like an automated browser that lets you interact with the page like a real person. Selenium, which you can use for other tasks besides collecting data generated by JavaScript, is a tool that will help you interact with the page on the website just before collecting data. Since the term interaction here may confuse you, let’s explain it with an example. You create interaction when you click a button on a website, fill out a form, tick a box, scroll up or down, or press any key on the keyboard. 4. Thoroughly Understand APIs If you have come this far, we can easily say that you have all kinds of information about scraping websites. However, if you are still not satisfied with where you are and want to improve yourself more, you can try interacting with APIs. API, short for Application Programming Interface, is used by many websites and the general purpose is to connect the front ends of the website to the back ends. Gathering data from a website’s APIs can be much faster and simpler than parsing and scraping the HTML using BeautifulSoup, or simply using the Selenium library to extract data from a website content created with JavaScript. Moreover, you can get the data on the website in a complete and structured way, just as the website itself gets from the backend just before the website shows it to you. Although it is not easy to implement this at first, there is no doubt that you can learn this if you have reached this stage. 5. Learn About More Tools Although you know all about web scraping and have done a lot of practice, the truth is that every time you start scraping more complex websites, you will face new challenges to overcome. However, you should not let this make you lose your motivation, because there will be many new tools you can use to meet these challenges. Best Resources for Learning Web Scraping We have already mentioned that web scraping is of an extremely complex nature, so learning web scraping can also be extremely difficult.

Books In addition to the internet, where you can access a lot of information as soon as possible, you should also consider making use of books. In the web scraping area, you can find books on Python web scraping, PHP web scraping, Java web scraping, and more. Many of these books have been covered by experts, many are also available in e-book form, and some are completely free. Here are the best books you can use to improve your web scraping knowledge: Web Scraping with Python by Richard Lawson: This book, which describes a web scraping process by combining real-life problems and solutions, is an extremely valuable book written by a real-life web scraping practitioner. After reading this book, you will learn in detail about Scrapy, learn how to deal with CAPTCHA, see how dynamics are handled, and learn what simultaneous downloads are.

Videos We have said that the internet is one of the fastest places to learn about a subject. Although it is claimed that there is a lot of worthless information on the Internet, the number of valuable resources is also quite high. If you want to get started with web scraping, you can also use videos, which can be an excellent resource for learning a new topic. You should also remember that a video helps a student gain the visual understanding necessary to understand a topic. In addition, if a student wants to understand the process better, they can watch the parts they want again. 4. Blogs Since data is obtained with web scraping and data is a serious need for companies from all industries, it has become popular day by day and everyone has started researching on the internet about web scraping. The result was blogs that gave clear information about web scraping and tried to explain the process accurately. While most of these blogs are ideal for beginners, some content has advanced information that can be used by experts as well. Access to these blogs is mostly completely free, and if a student has a question on a topic, the student will also be able to start a discussion with the author.

You can find all free proxy companies in the list that are fast, reliable and continuously available. Introduction A proxy server used for a personal case is linked to a specific location. This may allow specific access to geographically restricted content. For example, consumers can search and buy flights to the cheapest locations. Second, proxies can optimize users’ web activity and improve security by encrypting requests. For the proxies free list you are looking for, this article lists 8 of the best free proxy providers. In most cases, companies use proxy free website servers to gain an advantage over competitors by gathering insightful information. The proxy server allows them to export and process large amounts of publicly available data on competitors’ prices, products, services, ratings, or even trends, which can speed up the decision-making process. for companies that tailor marketing, sales and pricing strategies. Other advantages are its ability to, Locate a specific geographical location or device (such as mobile) Access to information from sites with IP restrictions Do unlimited simultaneous searches We know how difficult it is to choose fast proxies free service. That’s why we tested and ranked major private proxy providers to help you choose the best one for your needs. What is a proxy? A proxy is an intermediary between the user and the web that adds an extra layer associated with any site. Proxies have their own IP addresses, so the site the user is visiting will only see this IP proxy. In terms of origin, there are two types of proxies, the data center and the home: A data center proxy is a private proxy that is not associated with an ISP because it is connected and provides private IP authentication, high-level anonymity, and fast data request response times. Typically, data proxies are used for infrastructure, such as servers and web hosting. A server proxy is a proxy that uses an IP address associated with a physical location provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to a homeowner. It is a genuine IP address that can be used to mimic the behavior of organic users. Scrape.do Scrape.do offers a full range of services: from IP data centers (shared and dedicated), to residential proxies (shared, dedicated and mobile), to specialized tools that keep proxies internally and simply deliver the data you want. A huge team, many locations and rich targeting options. Scrape.do offers proxies free browser service using genuine Chrome browsers. Unlike other API services, it does not use tools like Selenium, it reveals the power of real browsers, removing the destination site without being banned. Using this method, the target site cannot detect whether it is a real web browser or Scrape.do crawlers. Scrape.do is free for 1000 requests each month! Just sign up and send request for web scraping . Credit card not required! Also integration can be done in as little as 2 minutes. See our web scraping documentation . The millions of proxies we have are enough to drive most sites. However, in some cases, it may be difficult to crawl destination sites. For this reason, we offer you the super-proxy server to maintain our success rate. The Super proxy pool has consists of IP at residential and mobile proxies . Requests submitted with a super proxy team will be charged up to 10 credits for each successful API call. 5 simultaneous requests are used for super proxy access. Both types of home servers have no limits and Scrape.do even encourages you to push them as much stress as possible. This is because the company uses so-called Super Proxies to balance the load. They make your requests go through an extra intermediate, but provide more stability in return. Storm Proxies It has just 70,000 proxies, with no real control panel, limited configuration options, and you can not even target the country in the few available US and EU locations. This is nothing compared to the bigger players. However, the company has carved out a comfortable position with a surprisingly loyal following. Storm Proxies is for short-term scrapers, sneaker coppers and Instagram administrators and will not try to talk to you to think otherwise. The price also says: the largest house plan costs $300. Some companies start with more, maybe double. Add some well-placed ads here and there, word of mouth and suddenly the popularity of Storm Proxies starts to make sense. The only real expectation here is that real proxies work well - and they do. PrivateProxy MPP proxies have a proven business model, selling only proxies with different access options. For example, PrivateProxy shared proxies are slightly cheaper than private or proprietary proxies, and the price per proxy becomes more affordable as you increase the number of proxies you purchase. The geography of their network is not so great: only 24 free proxies websites with a total of 220 servers. The maximum number of subnets you can purchase with a private proxy server is only 42, unless you offer a custom agreement with the MPP Group. As far as I know, they have a total of 520 subnets - a good number for any specialist broker. Private proxies from MyPrivateProxy perform very well and the success rate is always around or above 80%. This means that four of the five connection requests will be successful and will send the data you need. This changes with more connections: the more connections you send at a time (called concurrent proxy connections), the less successful your connections will be. This is very normal for proxies and the drop is not very significant. If you want a consistent success rate for hundreds of concurrent connections, you need to consider server hosting. Oxylabs Oxylabs is a Lithuanian brokerage provider that has been operating since 2012. Everything about it is business screams. From an original and neat site, to a list of credentials on the home page, to a dedicated account manager. Here you will find it difficult to find any of the usual proxy targets, such as sneakers, Instagram or Twitter. I’m sure the company will be happy to cover these usage cases (if your needs are large enough), but it does not seem to be the focus. Instead, you read things like ad verification, brand protection, market research, and business intelligence - as I said, business. In short, Oxylabs is placed as a proxy with a tie. There are two ways to start using Oxylabs. First, there is the usual route: fill out a registration form, confirm your email and you’re done. However, you will not be able to do much unless you have one of the two cheapest real estate agents - they are the only ones who allow self-service. If you need anything else, you should talk to your account manager first. BrightData BrightData is one of the most important players in the market, with more than 40 million residential IPs. Among the top free fast proxy providers, it is the second fastest and oldest known proxy provider. It is reliable and safe. Proxies cover all protocols, including SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS. It is also compatible with ASN. In addition to the original IP, the seller offers IP volume for mobile. If you are looking for a 100% guarantee, you can choose the type of unlock. The only downside is the price. Even the starting price of the smallest package is $ 500 per month as a commitment and $12.50 / GB for home servers. If you want to choose mobile IP, the prices reach $ 30 / GB. NetNut Most providers offer peer-to-peer networks, but NetNut offers home IPs from ISPs. NetNut combines with DiviNetwork to offer very fast proxy server speed, but it does not have a huge IP volume. The seller has two plans: on request and bandwidth. If you are looking for an affordable package, you can choose the larger ones. And, they also come with a personal account manager. In addition to speed, it has good stability and better data center performance than most vendors. They have IP with good availability at all times. As requests are routed to load balancing hyper-servers, the chances of getting a positive response are higher. You can run multiple concurrent sessions and the vendor claims to have sent 30 million requests a day. It also has a Chrome extension for easy use. The disadvantage of NetNut is the incompatibility with SOCKS5 and the availability of the list of allowed only in expensive packages. If you are ready to pay for the most expensive package, NetNut is a great choice. GeoSurf It offers a high quality IP pool and has 2 million IPs covering large geographical locations. It also provides a commitment to a high level of privacy. Pricing is convenient and cost effective. Plans limit bandwidth activity so you have unlimited IPs to use. The seller guarantees that IPs will never be blocked. The infrastructure also provides very reliable and highly available IPs. The best feature of GeoSurf is the ability to target free instagram proxies and other platforms that use age verification. GeoSurf offers Chrome and Firefox extensions for IP switching. The interface is good and comes with detailed information on the landing page. You can adjust the session time and change the port number as needed. The main disadvantage of GeoSurf is the lack of mobile IP telephony and incompatibility with SOCKS5. There is no trial version either, but it is a very reliable brand that has been active for more than a decade. Hide My Ass Hide My Ass offers a free proxy service, which is very convenient when you want to browse privately, but do not have the time or permission to download additional software or browser extensions. There are limitations - premium software offers faster speeds, more secure encryption and active malware protection - but for a quick browse, it’s a good choice. Hide My Ass the free proxies web covers your identity and IP address. It is one of the few services that allows you to select specific cities and not just countries to route your requests. The free proxy web service supports servers in New York, Seattle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London and Prague. Hide My Ass proxy collects log files, which include your IP address, the URLs you visit, the pages and files you viewed and when. It stores this data for 30 days - a policy that destroyed it on our wish list. How to choose the best private proxy Consider all this. Analyze their free proxy for websites, see how they are placed. There are usually two ways to present: Proxies for business . Business proxy providers will usually mention their use as market research, SEO, brand protection, fare collection, pricing, e-commerce, etc. Personal services . Personal providers typically talk about blockchain, unblocking websites, managing multiple social media accounts, sneaker copping (which is a business, but somehow it usually happens for personal use), Pokemon Go, Netflix, free Google proxies and more. I recommend contacting the provider before purchasing their product to make sure there are no hidden charges. They will usually also ask you about your target sites and the goals you would like your servers to achieve. Tell them as much as you can - they can help you optimize proxies specifically for your needs. Also, do not forget to read reviews. Although it agrees with the research, it is worth mentioning separately.  Here we are a free websites proxy review site, so if you are here - you are already on the right track to choosing the best provider! The advantages and disadvantages of private proxies Advantages Security . You do not need to notify private proxies, which means that your personal data is less likely to be compromised. Also, you do not have to worry about others doing something illegal with your lawyers that could cause you problems. Private proxies are much faster than semi-proprietary or shared proxies because you do not need to share bandwidth with anyone else. They do not slow down your browsing speed at all. Smaller number of blocks. Once again: if no one else is using proxies, you can be sure that they will not be blocked by sites like Google or Amazon. It is also more difficult to block when you start working with these IPs because you have complete control over them. Disadvantages Price . Because you will only use IP, there will be no one else to bear the cost. Therefore, you can expect to always pay more for the privilege of having your own agents. You can find cheap private proxies, but they will still be more expensive than shared proxies or semi-shared IPs. Paid proxies versus proxies online free With a free proxy server you can access almost every proxy advantage, which is great until it goes wrong. The use of such services means that no one is responsible for technical errors, which may be a common occurrence in this case. It is not easy to find best free proxies, long-term power of attorney as they quickly become obsolete and providers get paid or disappear over time. Paid proxies are responsible for their services, with contracts and agreements in force to protect the user. For businesses, there is no choice but to pay for an exclusive brokerage service and avoid potential security issues. If you choose a trusted proxy provider, you do not have to worry about server outages or disappearances for no reason, as many will offer exclusive account support. A trusted proxy provider will also have proxy servers of ethical origin. Conclusion Apart from these, there are many other reliable proxy suppliers in the market. Remember that just because a service provider is at the top of the list does not automatically make it ideal for your requirements. Examine in detail the possibilities and choose the one that suits your requirements and limitations."},

We will talk about how these practices have had a positive impact on the real estate industry. The real estate market can become a waste rather than an investment in the hands of people who do not know what they are doing. While real estate investments can provide very significant gains, risks should be calculated and minimized. The investment opportunities of the real estate market, which has an extremely competitive market, are based on many factors. The real estate market, which continues to grow day by day, brings with it new problems and solutions. It is therefore essential to analyze the key impacts in the real estate sector and to find new solutions to minimize the damage of fluctuations. With web scraping and crawling applications, it is possible to implement data-based decisions in the real estate field. Actors taking an active role in the real estate market use data scraping in areas such as assessing property value, evaluating rental returns, predicting market direction. Questions such as will prices rise or fall, which neighborhoods are in high demand, what properties need restoration are questions that real estate agents often ask themselves.To find the answers to these questions, a comparison must be made, and that means a lot of research data. As you can see, collecting thousands of data manually is like scooping water from the ocean. This is where web scraping comes in handy and comes to your aid. In this article, we will cover web scraping real estate data and data mining as Scrape.do experts. We will talk about how these practices have had a positive impact on the real estate industry. Scraping and Crawling Real Estate Data Web scraping is also called data scraping. This process means extracting the data of any public site that exists on the Internet. Identification and retrieval of data on the Internet are possible with web crawling and scraping. That is accomplished by automated software scripts. This is how we can access real estate data that is important to us. Once the predefined pages and sites are identified, the data scraping process begins. At this stage, web scraping focuses on collecting unstructured data from many online sources, aggregating that data, and making it ready for analysis. That is the best option as it will work much faster than a human. Why Scraping Real Estate Data is Essential? It is very common to scrape real estate data in the competitive real estate market we are talking about. This is how opponents become able to fight. With data extraction, a lot of very valuable information is obtained that you cannot normally obtain. In addition, since web scraping is carried out with coding, it will ensure that the information extracted about real estate is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date. In this way, it becomes predictable whether the real estate market will skyrocket in the near future or what price range the properties will be in. For businesses and real estate agents, web data is invaluable because it enables them to make better decisions; better pricing and a more substantial profit margin are also guaranteed. Here is the information you can access with web scraping: Public buyer-seller information, In-depth detailed information of the buildings, Pictures, Sales prices, Monthly rental prices, Type of properties, The location of the properties, The size of the properties, The advantages and possibilities of the properties, Parking spaces, Crime and safety statistics, Urban planning and urban transformation information, Construction permits, Earthquake resistance data, Property Type, Amenities, Estate agent… and lots of valuable information. Web crawling and scraping provide you with valuable information in this sense and keep you afloat in a competitive environment. Where Real Estate Data Scraping Use Let’s examine the cases: Real estate agencies use web scraping to collect massively real-time information from numerous data sources and present it to the benefit of consumers, making a profit. There are 2 reasons for this: Decision-making : Taking risks is part of every business, but in the real estate industry, this can result in huge losses. Therefore, even when taking risks, one should be sensible. Research is essential before buying or selling a property, but individuals cannot do it alone. Better, reliable, and much information is possible with scraping and crawling. Forecasting the market : Knowing when to buy and sell properties is essential to get the best and most profitable result. Some types of property gain popularity, while others lose value. Not knowing and following these developments can cause you great losses. Some locations may thrive, while others may stall. Therefore, you have to know the market. Likewise, this is best done by crawling and scraping. Monitoring the competition is the key to your survival in this highly competitive market. Thanks to data scraping, you can be aware of real-time pricing, access data quickly, and implement changes instantly. Product and service development becomes much faster and easier with scraping. Thanks to the algorithms, you can be instantly informed about the properties in need of restoration. You do not have to be in the industry to use scraping. You can use scraping to invest individually, buy a property, review your options. Buying and selling: Before trading, you need to accurately determine the value of your property. Otherwise, you can see a property you sell on a real estate site after 2 weeks for 2 times the price, and you may lose your taste. Data Mining After scraping the real estate data available on the web, data-mining begins. Real estate data mining refers to the phase of searching a large amount of aggregated data that will work. In order to make the most effective decisions in the sector, both real estate agents and companies need to know and analyze the consumer behavior that dominates the market. Data mining can be used in the following areas: Identifying market trends: It helps to analyze general market trends, facilitates competition. Knowing the real estate volatility period: By predicting the upcoming volatility, you can profit, avoid loss. Customer management: You can act in this way by learning customer consumption habits.

Web Scraping Introduction ‍ What Parts Does Scraping Data from the Internet Consist of? Used in almost all markets and industries, web scraping consists of two basic parts: web crawler and web scraper, where sellers plan new products and services based on customers’ experience. Continue reading this section to learn more about these sections and clear all your doubts about it. What is a Web Browser? A web browser, which we can also call a spider, is an artificial intelligence that browses the internet. These artificial intelligence monitors discover and index all links on the internet. The web browser, which is also tasked with searching for content, is an indispensable part of scraping data from the internet. In almost every work, you first need to promote a certain website or web, and then forward these addresses to the tool you use as a web scraper. What is Web Scraper? Web scrapers, which are tools designed to extract and organize all texts, photos, or videos on any web page accurately, quickly, and purposefully, may vary in design and complexity depending on the size of the project you will use. If you do not want to encounter problems caused by this change, it would be most logical to use a web scraper suitable for your project. Web scrapers also have data finders written to find the data you plan to scrape from the HTML file, web scrapers can easily access the data you want with these data finder software. What You Should Know About Web Scraping Tools Web scraping tools, which are programs specially written for the purpose of extracting, in other words, scraping, information that you have determined on certain websites and that are relevant to your subject, are programs that you should definitely use if you plan to collect data from a website programmatically. Are you ready to learn more about this software? Web scraping tools, when they are used to scrape any website, make HTTP requests to the target website, and all the data obtained through these requests are extracted from that page and transferred to another place in an organized manner. After the web scraping tool separates content that is publicly accessible and visible to all internet users, the server will process this information as HTML. In some cases, data scraping tools can also work to reach relevant data such as product prices, contact information in any database and which can be found in the browser thanks to HTTP requests. You can also find many web scraping tools on the market that have features that you can program and customize to suit your different projects. All scraping tools, in general, seem to be designed for all kinds of scraping, but they generally use programming libraries. ‍ ‍ How Do You Do Data Scraping From The Internet Without Any Support? If you want to scrape data from any website, you should know that you must first use scraping tools that are suitable for you and your purpose. If you have found a suitable scraping tool for you, you can list the things you need to do step by step as follows: As a first step, you should define your target website for the web scraper. Secondly, you need to collect the URL addresses of the pages from which you intend to extract data from this website. Thirdly, to get the HTML codes of these pages, you need to request these URL addresses with a web scraper. Fourthly, you should use locators to detect and find the data contained in the HTML of the pages. Finally, you need to save all the data you find in a JSON or CSV file format or a file format where you can access this information. After these processes are completed, you will have completed the data of the website you want without any support. However, if you are doing this for the first time and you are worried about mixing things up during the process, it is useful to get help from an expert team. If you choose us, you can be sure that if you encounter any problems, we will take care of you and do our best to solve your problem! Should You Scrape Data From The Internet By Yourself Or With An Expert Team? We explained the data scraping process that you can do yourself in the previous sub-title as simple and basic as possible. However, you should remember that this simplicity only applies when you have a small project. If you need data on a larger scale and larger sizes, you will have dozens of problems to overcome. The problems you have to deal with are to protect the web scraper program in case the layout of the website changes, to manage your proxy addresses, to manage Javascript nonstop, and to work against antibots. Since all of these problems we have mentioned and given as examples are technical problems that may cause excessive resource consumption, it can be quite difficult to deal with these problems when you are alone. In addition, the open-source internet data scraping tool you choose may have its limits, which may prevent you from accessing the data you want. So, if you are dealing with a small-scale project, you can do web data scraping yourself, but a large project requires an expert team. When deciding whether to do web scraping on your own or with a team, you should consider the size of your project. For What Purposes Are Internet Scraping Applications Used? Scraping data from the Internet is used for purposes such as price research, market research, following the news, examining the real estate market, and gaining potential customers. Doing Price Research When the statistics are examined and we consider our experience, price research is the most preferred action of people who want to scrape data from the internet. Price research, which is to extract the data of all products, services, and prices on e-commerce websites one by one, is a must-do for modern companies that want to follow a better pricing strategy. Firms that conduct price research can charge their products dynamically, optimize revenue, monitor competitors easily, and track which products are trending. Doing Market Research Market research, which is critical for companies and should be guided by the most accurate information available, is indispensable for a company’s development. High-quality data scraped from the internet will help you do market analysis. You can optimize the entry point, conduct research, and development, and monitor the movements of competitors with the data you obtain by conducting market research. Examining The Real Estate Market The fact that real estate sales and projects have turned digital in the last two decades puts the traditional firm in danger of collapse. Real estate agents and brokerages must incorporate product data scraped from the internet into their daily business, thereby protecting against online competition and making informed decisions in the market. With data scraping in the real estate field, companies can determine the value of the property they sell, predict the returns from any property and understand the direction of the real estate market. Following the News With just one news cycle, the media can add extraordinary value to your business or pose an existential and deadly threat to your business. If you own a company that relies on news analysis in the past or is frequently featured in internet news, scraping data from the internet will help you monitor the most critical news in your industry, collect information from this news and categorize the information you collect. Following the news also helps you make investment decisions, conduct online public sentiment analysis, organize political campaigns, do sentiment analysis, and monitor competitors. Gaining Potential Customers Gaining potential customers is a marketing and sales activity that is very important for any business you can think of.

What Do Proxy Servers Do? Proxy servers, which are the transition between the websites you visit and the device you use, are programs that should be used by anyone dealing with a business over the internet. Your traffic on the Internet passes through a remote machine designed to connect you to any server. The Web Proxy server hides the original IP address from the internet to see the IP of the proxy belonging to the website, sometimes it has been seen that the computers of other Proxy users are used for this hiding process. Proxies that can only work at the application level will redirect traffic from a single application for which you have installed your proxy and will not encrypt the traffic. ‍ Different Proxy Servers Proxy servers; There are nine in total, including Reverse Proxy, Web Proxy Server, Anonymous Proxy, High Anonymity Proxy, Transparent Proxy, CGI Proxy, Suffix Proxy, Distorting Proxy, and DNS Proxy. Let’s take a closer look at these Proxy servers! 1. Reverse Proxy The most important job of the Reverse Proxy server is to listen to the customer’s request and direct the customer to a specific internet server in line with their wishes in case there is more than one website on different servers. 2. Web Proxy Server Web Proxy servers that forward HTTP requests pass a URL instead of a path and a request is sent to which the Proxy server will respond. The problems of multiple Proxy servers are solved in such servers where the client-server Proxy auto-configuration protocol is used. 3. Anonymous Proxy Anonymous Proxy servers, a server is known for not creating an original and valid IP address, are detectable, but these servers also have the task of providing rational anonymity to the device that is the information client. 4. High Anonymity Proxy High Anonymity Proxy provides a more anonymous service than Anonymous Proxy. This Proxy, which does not allow the original IP address to be detected under any circumstances, cannot be detected by anyone. 5. Transparent Proxy Transparent Proxy, which never provides anonymity to the client and can be easily identified as an original IP address, is also used to act as a cache for websites. 6. CGI Proxy Developed to make websites more accessible, CGI Proxy is responsible for accepting and processing targeting requests of URL addresses using an internet form and returning the result to the web browser. 7. Suffix Proxy Suffix Proxy, which adds the proxy name to the URL to the content requested from the proxy and does not have a high level of anonymity, is used by many people to bypass the filters on the websites. Although it is easy to implement this Proxy, which is very easy to use, it has a lower usage rate due to increased internet filters. 8. Distorting Proxy Distorting Proxy is a proxy that uses HTTP headers to protect its privacy, replacing the original IP addresses with a completely false IP address to protect the privacy of the clients after the proxy servers are detected. 9. DNS Proxy DNS Proxy, which is completely different from other Proxy types and receives all requests in the form of DNS queries, is responsible for forwarding the requests it receives to the Domain server, where they can be cached, and routing the request flow from there. Types of Proxy Server Protocols We have briefly explained the four Proxy Server Protocols for you, namely Socks Proxy Server, FTP Proxy Server, HTTP Proxy Server, and SSL Proxy Server! Socks Proxy Server : Socks Proxy Server, which is responsible for providing a connection to a specific server, helps different data types such as TCS or UDP to become more layered depending on their protocols. FTP Proxy Server: The FTP Proxy Server, which caches all the traffic of FTP requests, is a server responsible for transferring these requests. HTTP Proxy Server: HTTP Proxy, which uses HTTP protocols, is frequently used by experts to process a one-way request to internet pages. SSL Proxy Server: SSL Proxy Server, which uses SOCKS Proxy protocol to allow appropriate requests of internet pages, is a Proxy server developed using TCP relay. What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)? A VPN is basically like a proxy, redirecting your internet traffic through a remote server and hiding your IP address so websites cannot see your real IP address or location. However, while Proxy servers work at the application level, VPN addresses work at the operating system level and completely replace and redirect traffic from your browser or background application. The VPN also encrypts the traffic between the Internet connection and the client device, preventing your Internet Service Provider from seeing what you are doing online. VPN encryption will additionally protect you from government surveillance, hackers, and website tracking. ‍ Types of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) The most commonly used VPN types are Remote Access VPN, Site-to-Site VPN, Intranet Based VPN, and Extranet Based VPN. Remote Access VPN: Allowing an internet user to connect to a remote private network and access all the services and resources of this internet remotely, Remote Access VPN takes place over the Internet, which is a secure and private connection. This type of VPN is useful for both home internet users and workplace internet users. Site-to-Site VPN: Site-to-Site VPN, also called Router-to-Router VPN and used quite frequently in large companies, is used among companies and organizations with branches in different locations. Intranet-based VPN: The VPN used when the same company has more than one office and they are connected using Site-to-Site VPN is called Intranet-based VPN. Extranet-based VPN: When a company uses a Site-to-Site VPN to connect to another company’s office, it is called Extranet-based VPN. Virtual Private Network (VPN) Protocol Types We can list the protocols used specifically for VPNs as Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), OpenVPN, Secure Shell (SSH), SSL, and TLS. Read on to learn about these protocols with different features! Internet Protocol Security (IPSec): Used to secure Internet communication on an IP network, Internet Protocol Security carefully encrypts each data packet during Internet connection, protecting Internet protocol interaction by authenticating the Internet session. IPSec VPN works in two different modes, Transport Mode and Tunneling Mode. The tunnel mode is responsible for encrypting the entire data packet, while the transport mode’s task is to encrypt the messages in the data packet so that only the reader can understand it. Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP): A tunneling protocol that combines with another security protocol, such as IPSec, to establish a secure VPN connection, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol tunnels between two L2TP ports. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP): Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, which creates a tunnel and encrypts and confines the data packet, is one of the most commonly used VPN protocols and has been used since the first version of Windows. This protocol can be used in Mac and Linux operating systems besides Windows. SSL and TLS: SSL, which stands for Secure Sockets Layer, and TSL, which is Transport Layer Security, create a VPN that an internet browser will treat as a client and where user access to certain applications is prohibited. TLS and SSL protocol, which are frequently used in online shopping sites, is also integrated with internet browsers. Internet browsers do not require any action to switch to the SSL protocol. The URL addresses where SSL connections are used are preceded by HTTPS, not HTTP. OpenVPN: An open-source VPN that is frequently used to create Point-to-Point or Site-to-Site connections, OpenVPN uses a security protocol based on the SSL and TLS protocol. Secure Shell (SSH): Secure Shell, which creates VPN tunnels where data transfer takes place and ensures that these tunnels are encrypted separately, has its own connections and client. Data using this protocol is sent from a local port to a remote server with an encrypted tunnel created by SSH VPN. What are the Differences Between Proxy and VPN? Although VPNs and Proxy Servers seem similar in terms of their intended use and features during use, this two software have many different features. If you are confused about whether you need a VPN or a Proxy Server, read this comparison we prepared for you and your confusion will be cleared up a lot! Which One Is More Reliable? Proxy servers, which can easily hide your identity from websites, cannot show the same performance in hiding your connection. Using a proxy server that cannot encrypt your connection will offer a less secure connection than connecting to a web server with a browser. VPNs, which are a more reliable solution than proxies, are tasked with encrypting data just before sending it to the client. So VPNs will hide your identity from the internet and ISP. Which One Gives More Importance to Privacy? While VPN and Proxy Servers are tasked with effectively hiding the IP address of the people using them, they will process the data presented to them in quite different ways. Although proxy servers, which see themselves as an intermediary between an internet user and the internet, will hide the IP address of the internet user from the internet server visited by the users, they cannot fully provide the security received from this website and given to the website. This will result quite differently when you use a VPN. VPNs that hide the IP address and location of the internet user, thus preventing them from being identified, provide true privacy for the internet user by using end-to-end encryption so that an ISP or router cannot access the internet user’s data. In addition, even if the data encrypted by the VPN is captured by malicious internet users, they will not be able to access the data unless they can decrypt it. Which One Is Faster? Proxy, which is a server that can be used by many internet users at the same time, can cause connection speed delays when used. If you are planning to use a free proxy connection, we can say that your internet connection will be quite slow. Although the use of a VPN server far from the internet user’s location will also cause the connection speed to decrease, a VPN provider with the right technology will not make you feel that there is a delay.

We will answer all the questions you have in mind and provide you with the best service we can offer. What is a Data Pool? The data pool, which is the set of values ​​that contains all the data obtained from a central database, can consist of data in any field. The data in the pool can be anything from store information to employee records, or it can be created automatically or manually for analysis purposes. Database software, on the other hand, is software designed to implement functions related to the pool. In its basic sense, we can say that all kinds of data collected for analysis can be considered as a data pool. Since the method by which you collect the data may affect the accuracy of the data and values ​​in the pool, it may also change the result of your analysis as good or bad. For this reason, if you are not doing a large data collection, it would be more logical to use manual data collection. However, if the data set you need to review and collect is a large set, an automatic data collection process, namely web scraping, will be the best option. Who Can Access the Data Pool? The data pool created on any subject can be in two different ways as private access and sharing, to distinguish the people who can reach it. Private data pool can only be seen by the administrator, no one other than the administrator can access this data pool. A shared data pool can be accessed by people who can add, edit, or remove values. Although a web-based data pool is shared by an administrator, online users can access the data for any purpose and export this data on a regular basis using web scraping. How to Create a Data Pool? Data pooling, which is the process of combining data or data sets obtained from different sources, is carried out in two different stages. In the first stage, there is more general knowledge, while in the second stage, more specific data is collected. To explain with an example, in the first stage, the brands that people in different countries prefer to buy computer equipment are researched, while in the second stage, why people prefer these pieces of equipment is researched. So the pooling system has to be from the general to the specific. What is Used to Create a Data Pool? Since data pools consist of data from any website or websites on the Internet, it will be necessary to scrape the data on these websites. You need to use a web scraper to do this scraping, but when you use the web scraper software on its own IP address, your IP address may be blocked from accessing that website by the website owner as it constantly requests your IP address. To avoid such situations, you need to use a Rotating Proxy when you use a web scraper. In other words, you need a web scraper and a Rotating Proxy for web scraping to create a data pool. With this two important software, you can scrape any website you want, and you can create a data pool from the data you scraped. ‍ What is a Rotating Proxy? Rotating Proxy automatically returns your requests in a larger IP Proxy pool every time you reconnect with a Proxy server, presenting you with a new IP address each time. With Rotating Proxy, you don’t need to create a proxy rotation infrastructure and force people to leave their computers on to maintain this infrastructure. You just need to send your requests to the Proxy server without any hassle, your proxy server will give you a different Proxy server for every request. And don’t forget to make sure you use a different Proxy address every time you make a request to the website you’re aiming to scrape or reach. What Does a Rotating Proxy Do? By using Rotating Proxy, it is possible to show that many different users are connecting to the same website by preventing multiple requests that you send from appearing as coming from a single user. With this simulation process, you can bypass advanced anti-bot systems, overcome all obstacles to reach your target data, and access the data you plan to obtain easily and successfully. Even if the IP address you used while using Rotating Proxy was blocked by the website, you will most likely be successful as your next request will come from a different IP address thanks to the Rotating Proxy you use. While Rotating Proxies can be implemented with both data center proxies (aka private proxies) and residential proxies, residential proxies are a more effective method. If you use both data center proxies and residential proxies at the same time, your success rate in scraping data from the internet will be greatly increased and you will not encounter any failures. Some Reasons to Use a Rotating Proxy to Create a Data Pool While a simple and fairly basic Proxy pool can work for many use cases, it’s always best to use a Rotating Proxy for web scraping to the data pool. Let’s take a look at why you should use a Rotating Proxy for web scraping: Requests You Make To Websites Do Not Go From A Single IP Address The main advantage of using a recommended Rotating Proxy for web scraping is that your requests can easily span thousands of IP addresses, although an individual Proxy can guarantee you privacy, it cannot guarantee that your IP address will not be blocked or seen. Since you will have thousands of IP addresses, it becomes possible to easily scrape a website on a large scale. You won’t have to worry about Proxy as Rotating Proxies will give you a single API endpoint to forward your requests to your target website and your proxy’s layer will automatically forward your requests. By Using a Rotating Proxy, You Can Easily Bypass Anti-Bot Actions As web scraping is becoming more popular and used by more and more people, websites are taking advantage of anti-bot software and CSN solutions written to prevent scrapers from accessing information. Taking such precautions by websites prevents you from easily accessing the data you need, and even some proxies and web scraper software cannot bypass these barriers. However, if you use a proper Rotating Proxy, you can scrape the data you want without any problems and you won’t be in any danger of getting your IP address banned. You Can Scrape Data from Different Regions Simultaneously Using a Rotating Proxy Many of the Proxy services on the market have features that allow you to divide your proxy connections into several jobs. Since IP addresses can be assigned from any region to these connections you have reserved, it becomes possible to simultaneously access data on locally prepared websites. Let us explain this with an example. If you want to start a florist company but are using web scraping to find out where to buy the best and cheapest flower seeds, you may want to compare a California florist and a New York-based florist and combine their data in the same category. By using a Rotating Proxy, you can access the data at the address you want without any restrictions or danger of bots. ‍ When You Use a Rotating Proxy, Your Request cannot Be Restricted By Websites Big websites like Google, Amazon, or Facebook use software to limit the number of requests from any IP address, after which the CAPTCHA page is presented. In these cases, to access a website, you must have access to a pool of thousands or millions of IP addresses. You can also obtain this access by using a Rotating Proxy . In addition, Rotating Proxies not only increase your chances of having the most complete and accurate data but also assign a private IP to your every request, so you can scrape the data you want without being restricted by websites. What is Data Center Rotating Proxy? Data Center Rotating Proxy, which uses a different data center for each request, is a server that automatically changes Proxies. If you use a data center proxy when you want to connect to a website, the server of the proxy you use will assign you a different IP address located in the data center. Datacenter IP addresses are IP addresses that are not tied to an internet service provider, but to an organization or entity that owns a data center or proxy pool. What is a Residential Rotating Proxy? Residential IP addresses used by Residential Rotating Proxies are IP addresses that are arranged separately for each device connected to the internet and show the internet service provider that helps this device to connect to the internet in addition to the geographical location of the device. Since each residential IP address is connected to a different real device and is registered to a specific home address, we can say that Residential IP addresses are connected to a real person or device. Although these IP addresses are assigned to users as well as belonging to the internet service provider, it would not be wrong to state that these IP addresses have a higher verification rate than data center IP addresses. For this reason, it is always more reasonable to use residential IP addresses for all the services you will use online or the websites you will browse. Which Is The Best Rotating Proxy Service? For a Rotating Proxy service to be good, it needs to offer you a fairly large network width and a rich pool of IP addresses. In addition to these, the support team should be with you in any problem and solve your problems. You should also make sure that the price you pay covers the service you receive.

Benefits for Scraping", "content": "With the help of IP rotation, you can rotate your IP to a whole another location so that the request will be sent to your new IP address, which contains a different location address than yours. So the chances to be banned reduced nearly to zero. Let’s get into the details! Today, in the digital age, the primary source of information is the Internet. You can find any information related to daily life, health issues, or prices of new gaming computers. Even some well-known universities upload their courses to adapt to how things work in the digital era. We can reach any information with one tap on our mobile phones. So far, everything seems so reasonable. However, there is some bad news. You can not be on the loose on the Internet as websites and governments set some restrictions. Governments may ban online content they don’t like, and this is a raging issue. According to Freedom House’s report, the freedom on the Internet rate was 30 percent in 47 countries in 2012, and the number decreased to 22 percent at the end of 2018. However, there are some alternative methods to free the Internet, such as Proxy services and IP rotations. IP rotation enables you to surf the web more freely. The web pages would recognize the request you send with your local IP, and you may not get the HTML information in return due to the local restrictions and IP bans. Nevertheless, with the help of IP rotation, you can rotate your IP to a whole another location so that the request will be sent to your new IP address, which contains a different location address than yours. So the chances to be banned reduced nearly to zero. Let’s get into the details. ‍ What Does IP Rotation Mean? First, what is an IP address? Each IP address is a unique number that identifies devices connected to the web, and it reveals information including the city, the area code of ISP, your ISP’s name, and ZIP code etc. It is like the physical addresses of ours. IP rotation is the application of assigning different IP addresses to the online device at given periods. IP rotation could also change IP addresses at random intervals. When you are connected to the Internet with your ISP, internet service provider, your device is instantly assigned to a random IP address from the pool of IPs. If the current IP is banned or somehow you lose the connection to the Internet, the system automatically tries to reconnect. And during that time, the Internet service provider will pull the other available IP address and assign it to your online digital device. ISPs rotate IPs as the number of users exceeds IP addresses on their hands. As the IP address of a random user disconnects from the web, the internet service provider determines the address as available and match the waiting user’s online device with the idle IP address from their pool of IP addresses. So the resources of IP addresses are used most efficiently. What Is Web Scraping And What Is It Used For? Web scraping, also known as web harvesting, or web data extraction, is a widespread technique often used by data analysts for various reasons related to their projects. The web scraping tools are used fort o extract large amounts of data automatically from web pages, and it stores these large datasets in its database system. Mostly, web scraping tools save those datasets in a spreadsheet format. The only way to monitor data is using a browser application, and web pages generally set obstacles to prevent someone from copying, saving, or downloading their data. If you need specific data from a target website, you may do it manually. Copying, pasting and keeping all those data is a very tedious thing to do, and it would probably take quite a long time, which could be more useful somewhere else. Web scraping tools saves all the time wasted by doing the process manually, by conducting all actions automatically. Based on your preferences and requirements, a web scraping tool will access, scan, and extract information automatically from various websites simultaneously. What Is Web Scraping Used For? Simply, web scraping tools are used for obtaining the data. Accessing tons of data, extracting these data to eventually categorize and eliminate the unrelated ones, and with the meaningful ones, analyzing in order to have a deep insight could make a vast difference for a business to succeed in their own sector. In today’s modern world and business environment, having a deep understanding related to your business is one of the most efficient competitive advantages.

Price monitoring via web scraping tools is essential for the most competitive firms these days. Web scraping tools are used for building phone and e-mail sheets to reach out to potential and targeted customers. Moreover, web scraping methods are also used to collect vast data for the most testing phase of machine learning projects. See More Details About Data Crawler Software Why Is IP Rotating Is Important For Real-Time Data And Web Scraping? Most web scraping tool users are experiencing the problem of getting blocked. A ban from some specific content-related web pages would reduce the potential of the web scraping tool as it will not be able to access these particular content anymore. Web pages use a bot-prevention system. If the system receives so many requests from the same IP address, it will automatically categorize that IP address as a bot and restrict its access to the website. But, there are some methods to avoid the risk of getting banned. These are rotating the IP addresses, using public or private proxies, or spoofing and rotating user agents. To dodge the bot detectors of web pages, using three of these techniques might be beneficial. And, therefore, the ban risk will be reduced dramatically. Using the IP rotation method helps to web scraping tool to send request multiple requests. As of now, the bot protection system will see that these requests are not from a single location, which, basically, would be a bot, but from different locations across the world. So as to use web scraping tools at their total capacity, there shall be no restrictions stopping web scraping tools from reaching websites and extracting the necessary data. With no measurements for IP address ban risk, web scraping tools will always have a limited capacity. And, it may not reach price information of some web service as there might be geo-restrictions due to the government legislations or your IP address might have just been banned. ‍ The Advantages Of IP Rotating Proxies For Web Scraping Proxies with the IP rotation feature is an essential service for various businesses. Services that provide security for their users while surfing the Internet use rotating IP proxies to secure their own information. Cybersecurity firms shall use such a service because they need to check millions of web pages to operate their businesses.

So, it hides your IP address which is your digital identity, which enables you to stick around the web with anonymity and privacy. And the followings are the benefits of rotating IP changer Proxy services: The Increased Level Of Reliability Proxies that are frequently rotating the IP address of your device provide you with a higher degree of reliability than surfing on the Internet without an IP rotation Proxy. The requests that are being sent through your digital device are assigned to a unique IP address. And, to avoid geo-restrictions or the chance of getting banned, users often do change their own IP addresses. Doing all these processes frequently and manually during a project takes quite a time and distracts users from the other aspects of the project. And IP rotating Proxy service assigns each request to a different available IP address from their IP pool. So, the whole process is done by the IP rotating service, and you can focus on more crucial factors related to your project. Eliminates The Risk Of Limit Ban Websites do use anti-bot and security measurements, and they keep improving these applications. The standard versions of proxies could hide your device’s IP address and provide anonymity. However, if there is no IP rotation feature, the Websites’ security system will add suspicious IP addresses to the blacklist after some point. If bot-like activity continues, the anti-bot system will ban your IP address eventually. Moreover, websites often use rate-limiting methods to control traffic circulation of their websites. They monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to check the stability of the server of the web page. This system is designated to limit the number of requests occurring from each IP address. Therefore, the would-be no responses of information for these IP addresses. For the daily users of the Internet, this is not a big deal. However, if you are using web scraping tools to extract data, you can survive the limiting control of these websites by using an IP rotating Proxy."},

Let’s examine the most known security measures they will take when this suspicious activity is detected by the site. See Also: Market Research and Web Scraping IP blocking When there are too many data requests from your IP to the site, the most common security measure is that the site will identify you as suspects such as DDOS attackers or bots and blacklist your IP. How do you know if your IP is blacklisted? If your IP is blacklisted, you will not be able to log in to that site with the same IP again. Wrong data But if you can access the site, do not immediately consider yourself lucky. Some sites may choose to send you false data when they realize that you are trying to dig up your data. As a result of the fake data you will receive, you will be pushed into the background while trying to get ahead of the competition. Captcha Most sites prevent you from digging into their data by populating Captcha verification when more data is requested than a human could possibly want. That’s why the “I’m not a robot” statement that we come across many times. But fear not, at scrape.do we will teach you the easiest methods to avoid these blocking methods. How to Avoid Blocking methods? Simply, you need to use more than one IPs. You have to use multiple IPs. The bot you will use will switch to a different IP after sending a request from one IP.

Proxy servers have warning systems, a list of malware websites that notification users are accessing these websites. The Internet is very similar to the nature of our universe. Internet doesn’t seem to have borders, and it keeps expanding its boundaries just like the space. We still do not know if we are alone in this universe or not, yet we are aware that on the Internet, there is everyone. Happy ducklings videos, random name generators, car dealerships, good-intentioned people, bad-intentioned people. So, just like in real life, you need to distinguish between good and evil. Residential Proxy servers are great services to help you to surf freely and safely on the Internet, with anonymity. Proxy servers have warning systems, a list of malware websites that notification users are accessing these websites. Furthermore, Proxy server services are also important for businesses. For instance, if you are working in a market data analysis firm, you can not survive the jungle of the web without the help of a proper Proxy server. For the market analysis, it is necessary to scan thousands of web pages and analyze the contents on these websites. These experts often use web scraping or web data extraction tools to conduct their job to automate the steps. However, accessing all those thousands of websites without a Proxy server seems impossible due to the geo-specific restrictions of service providers or bot-like actions detecting security systems of websites. Besides that, even though market analyzers dodge geo-restrictions and IP bannings, it is not safe to surf thousands of websites with your real IP address. In this article, we will talk mostly about Proxy servers and why Proxy servers are important services when it comes to mining the web with web scraping tools. What Is A Proxy Server- And How Does It Work? The job of a Proxy server is to stand between you, your online devices, and the Internet and convey any interaction between the two. So, as it stands still in the middle, like a security guard, proxy servers are often used to stop cyber attacks trying to access a private network by keep sending requests. Think about Brooklyn Bridge, how it connects New York City and the city of Brooklyn, and how it enables the daily interactions between the two. So, similar to a real bridge-like Brooklyn Bridge, a Proxy server is basically a “gate” between daily users of the Internet and the websites they visit. When a digital device connects to the web, it does it with an IP address. It is like when you are entering a country for a holiday and show your visa at the entrance. IP address works like your identity card. Your online device’s unique IP address contains all the necessary information to distinguish it from other online devices. When you send a request to a web page via a residential Proxy server, your IP address reveals some information related to your online devices, including your city, the ZIP code of your location, your ISP, and the name of your ISP. ‍ How Does Proxy Server Use For Data Mining And Why Does It Necessary? As we also mentioned in this article, when you are surfing on the Internet, a unique number is assigned to your online digital device, which is your unique IP address. And your IP address should look something like this; 254.249.197.101. An IP address is the identity card of the Internet, and it basically provides host/network identification and location addressing services. So if you are in a location you do not know, you can use your IP address as a map to find out where you are at. Using a Proxy server enables you to convey your request from your online device to the web pages with the unique IP address of the Proxy server. Hence, when you are using a Proxy server as an “intermediary”, you also use its identity card, IP address. So that the websites would not be able to see your real IP address, thanks to this, you are able to mine data throughout the web with anonymity, lower chance of getting banned, and more safety. ‍ The Reasons Why It Is Necessary To Use A Proxy Server While Data Mining? A Proxy server is a crucial detail for to mine data from websites, and these are the main reasons: Avoid Rate Limits Admins of web pages generally take the security of their websites seriously. To take care of their server’s stability, they frequently use rate limits so as to check the incoming and outgoing traffic of their website. Moreover, most websites with a valid security measurement have software designated to detect any suspicious bot-like actions, such as sending multiple requests from the same IP address. Multiple requests coming from the same IP address in a very short period of time generally means that there is an automated bot-like action. Admins of these websites are aware of this fact and prefer to use rate-limiting software so as to reduce the unnecessary rush on their websites, which harms the condition of their server. When the number of the request exceeds the normal rate, the security software of websites steps in and ban the IP address to avoid any future request for some time. This is an annoying situation to face if you are mining the web with web scraping tools, as it limits web scraping tools range of scanning thousands of web pages daily. To avoid these restrictions, to free your web scraping tools, you need more multiple IP addresses to send those multiple requests, and this is possible with a residential Proxy server. So, the target website will encounter multiple requests from various IP addresses, which is quite usual. There is nothing to worry about. And, as all these servers will send a number of requests within the limits of security software, they do not trigger any scraping-bot detector. Therefore, you will be using web scraping tools to mine data from thousands of websites freely and safely. They will not know that you are coming. The Anonymity That Is Coming With Your Hidden IP Address Proxy services are mostly used to hide your online digital device’s IP address. Therefore, you don’t have to reveal your IP address which reveals some information about you, including the city you are living, and the exact ZIP code of your location. This information could be dangerous when they are in the hands of ill-wishers people. However, when you use a Proxy server as an “intermediary”, the websites only see the IP address of the residential Proxy server, as your real IP address is hidden. And due to the similarity of the assigned IP address and your device’s original IP address, the website will not realize what your real IP address actually is. Moreover, since your device’s IP address is hidden, you are provided with anonymity, which enables you to access the websites that are geographically banned in your location. Geographic Internet restrictions are also serious obstacles for web scraping tools as these restrictions stop web scraping tools from reaching these contents and extracting data out of them. For instance, if you want to watch American content on Netflix from Belgium, the content probably has geographic limitations due to the regulations and policies of Netflix. Yet, with a Proxy server, you can use pull an IP address from the USA and freely send requests from that American IP to the American content on Netflix. Besides that, now you are able to scrape these geo-IP restricted websites freely. Can Residential Proxy Servers Be Detected? Generally, residential Proxy servers are hard to be detected as their online footprint is very small for web pages’ security systems to realize. Besides that, residential Proxy services use their residential IP addresses, and this also makes things difficult for websites’ security software. Nevertheless, some websites take their security more seriously and use IPQS’ Proxy Directions services which applies more than one test so as to determine whether the origin of the coming request is from an IP address related to a Proxy server, botnet, or does it just belong to the daily Internet user. ‍ Does Proxy Server Increase The Speed Of Your Internet? Yes, it is possible. Proxy servers are sometimes used to have an increased speed of the Internet and to save bandwidth by accessing websites and documents which had already been accessed by various users, and the data is already on the desk of the Proxy server. So, descendent users are able to reach without using the bandwidth of their Internet. Your internet speed might also increase via a Proxy server as they often compress traffic and have ad-block systems. So, you do not have to spend some of your bandwidth on loading unnecessary ads on websites, which speeds up your Internet. Are Proxy Servers Illegal To Use? No, it is not. It is legal to use Proxy server services. Proxy servers have various different functions, such as during these pandemic days. The proxy server enables people to work remotely, securing online users from the malicious contents of the Internet, and accessing online services from outside of the country, etc. Learn More IP Rotation With the help of IP rotation, you can rotate your IP to a whole another location so that the request will be sent to your new IP address, which contains a different location address than yours.

Then this article will be helpful for you. Let's have a look at the details!", "h1": "All Countries Proxy Server- Bypass Geo-Blocking Right Now", "content": "Want to explore all countries proxy servers in order to bypass geo-blocking? Then this article will be helpful for you. Let’s have a look at the details! Geographical boundaries are almost meaningless when you are living in the worldwide digital world of today, which is one of the biggest advantages of living in this age. Travelers may make use of all of the material accessible in their home country (or any other nation for that matter) via the use of any of the smart gadgets they have access to. Unfortunately, content providers and certain governments are attempting to restrict access to select websites and services by using geo-blocking measures. You may simply get around them by using a few easy applications and approaches. Using Scrape.do’s proxy services is one of them! What Is Geo-blocking and How Does It Work? User geo-blocking refers to the practice of denying access to a product or service to users who reside in certain countries. It is possible to geo-block a product by whitelisting the territories that have been authorized access, or, in more sensitive instances, by blacklisting particular nations from ever trying to access it. It doesn’t matter what method of restriction is used; geo-restricted material might have the same effect as forbidden fruit. So much so that individuals came up with a variety of strategies to get around it. Some service providers have even gone so far as to prohibit users who even try to evade geo-restriction regulations. The most surefire option would be to physically relocate to one of the locations in which the service is offered, which would be the most expensive. However, since that is no longer an option, we will move our attention to another approach a.k.a using a proxy that may be done from the comfort of your own home. Reasons for Geo-Blocking Websites gather a great deal of information about you the instant you arrive on their page, mostly via the use of web cookies and your Internet Protocol address. If you’ve already searched for the same flights, event tickets, or car rental alternatives via a certain online shop, boosting the price (especially for you) the second time may cause you to worry and pay the higher amount right away. Depending on your nation of origin or postcode, they could assume you’re prepared to spend a little extra money for your goods. The purchasing patterns and interests of your projected age group may also help websites change pricing or conceal cheaper items, such as advertising only up-market hotel choices – which has the extra disadvantage of making a region or city seem more booked-out than it really is. This is known as dynamic pricing. It is a prevalent way of web marketing and a commonly used reason for geo-blocking other than governmental restrictions. ‍ The second most-often reason for geo-blocking is licensing or copyright protection. Online service must possess the distribution rights to a specific piece of content in your location in order to lawfully distribute it in that particular market. It’s typical for a streaming service to have distribution rights to a program in certain areas but not others, as is the case with many television series. Similarly, YouTube videos fall under this category. Consider the possibility that you may come upon a video clip from a movie that is geo-blocked in your country. In most cases, this is because the content uploader, who is often a film distribution firm, does not have permission to release the movie or its excerpts in your country. Another motivation for geo-blocking is to divide the world’s marketplaces into various segments. Streaming services will customize their offerings to meet the needs of certain market segments, which may include various price structures, languages, and preferred content. It’s also the reason why certain services aren’t accessible in specific regions or nations. A good example is the fact that several European nations have local streaming services that are not accessible in Asia. What Is the Procedure for Geo-Blocking? Geo-blocking is accomplished by tracing your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Your IP address is similar to your physical home address in that it discloses your location. The procedure is as follows: IP addresses are assigned to your laptop, phone, and any other device that connects to the internet, and these addresses are given by your internet service provider. As a result, your Internet service provider knows where you are, what devices you are using, and what you are doing online. With specialized software, it is possible to monitor your internet activities with simplicity and track which websites are visited and at what times of the day you visit them. To a certain extent, the position of your gadget may be determined. In this way, a website may determine from what nation you are viewing it. The information is then used by website administrators to implement geo-blocking measures. Proxies and Geo-Blocking If you’re interested in learning more about how to circumvent geo-blocking without losing performance, then you should pay attention to proxy servers. A proxy server is a server that requests the internet resource you want on your behalf or your computer device. You may use the IP address of this intermediary to access websites that are prohibited in your location. Proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs) function in the same manner, with the exception that the former does not scramble traffic data. This means that rerouting your data streams across proxy servers does not need any encryption. However, as a result of this, you will be able to surf the internet considerably more quickly. If you have never used a proxy service before, don’t simply go with the first one you come across. When it comes to protecting your privacy, you should be picky about your choices. You won’t go wrong with any of the well-known names, on the other hand. How Do Proxies Function? You may use the IP address of the country whose content you want to view while sitting in any part of the globe, thanks to the international proxy servers provided by trusted proxies. As a result, you will be able to read the unlocked material on the web and avoid losing out on essential information that may be beneficial to you in your business venture. The fast and secure proxy server also guarantees that you get correct search results, which will aid you in finding the information you want. When it comes down to it, a proxy server is essentially a computer program that serves as a middleman between clients and the other servers that provide the services they need. When a client asks for a service such as a file that is only accessible on a separate server, the client connects to a proxy, which analyzes the request and attempts to process it from the dispersed systems. ‍ Proxy Servers and Geo-Blocking The usage of a proxy server to access geo-restricted material is a straightforward strategy. Suppose that the server that needs to be contacted limits certain contents based on the location of the site that is being seen. In this case, we might use a proxy to disguise the filter that the destination server is using. Or suppose a destination server geo-blocks its service to a certain country based on the IP address of the country in question. A proxy of that country may be used to see the destination server’s contents as if they were being viewed by the inhabitants of that country. Learn More Fast Public Proxies and How They Work Explore how fast public proxy services work and how they can make your web scraping job done. Folks, there is an endless technology behind here. Explore with Scrape.do! ‍ The Advantages of Using a Proxy Server Other than helping you get past geo-blocks, using a proxy server has many advantages. The use of a proxy server may assist to keep the cost of hardware down. Many firms have their computers all linked to and managed by a single server, which causes separate internet connections for each system to become an issue as a consequence of this. As a result, each computer may be attached to one proxy server, which can be linked to the main server through a network connection. Then there’s the caching proxy server, which does exactly what it says. Requests are processed more quickly as a result of retrieving back the material that was already stored from a previous request. In addition, they preserve copies of frequently requested content, allowing large enterprises to reduce their upstream bandwidth costs and usage. The likelihood that you will wind up accessing dangerous websites when surfing the internet is quite high. You will suffer irrevocable harm to your system in the event that you access a malicious website. In addition, there are countless untrustworthy websites that have been put up by hackers. Attempting to get access to one of them will result in the exposure of all of your personal information. When you use a proxy server, your system will not send the request directly to the websites you are visiting on the internet. The proxy end will always be on the receiving end of the risks provided by such sites. This helps your system to keep the highest level of protection possible. With the advanced and secure system of Scrape.do, you have extra protection next to using a proxy."},

Yes, we have waited for you. Let’s have a seat, we are starting. Internet is an endless area. In your daily life on the internet, you use a very tiny bubble of such an ocean. For instance, you send cat videos to the people you love or flirt with strangers online. These are the tip of the iceberg. What is going on behind the scene is a whole other story. Very simply, requests go, and information comes. And, most of you are probably using a public proxy service at your campus,  office, or even on a bus, without even realizing it. Public proxy services are devices, and they are here for transferring and directing traffics between protocols and networks. Public proxies are very functional services ranging from various areas, but especially in web scraping tools. Public proxy service is the perfect match for web scraping and data extraction tools. Because public proxies allow web scraping tools to scan and extract data more freely and faster on the web. Without a public proxy service, the range of web scraping tools would be more limited as most of the websites has local restrictions. What Is Public Proxy Service? – How Can I Get A Public Proxy Public proxies are instant bridges builders between the web and online users. As it tunnels users to the websites, public proxies are also known as “intercessors.” Devices that are connected to the internet have a unique address called the IP address. Public proxy servers also have their own IP addresses. It combines online digital devices with web pages. Your mobile phone, for example, has both of these addresses. As you surf through the web, you keep sending entrance requests to the URLs by simply clicking on them. The entire process is tunneled to the proxy. When the response arrives at the public proxy server, the server takes the data from the web page and sends these pieces of information to your online device. How Can I Have A Public Proxy? Public proxy servers could be divided into two, namely software public proxies and hardware public proxies. A hardware public proxy is located in the middle of the internet and online device’s own network. This is the bridge where the core function is going on, obtaining, sending, and directing the data provided by the web pages. If it is a software public proxy, on the other hand, it is located on a cloud server. After you download the app on your online device, software public proxy does basically the same thing with a hardware public proxy. Services of both proxies could be obtained by a monthly or annual subscription method. From time to time, service providers may also offer a free month. Or, some of these services are entirely free, yet, of course, these public proxies have some disadvantages compared to the paid ones. Public proxies are free services. They let users enter their IP addresses and keep their anonymity throughout the web.  Generally, free types provide users with fewer amount of URLs and can be run on a limited number of digital devices. On the other hand, paid versions of proxies barely have limitations when surfing online. ‍ What Are The Advantages Of Public Proxy Servers Proxy servers have various advantages ranging from empowered security and anonymity to avoiding area-specific limitations. Smart businesses use these benefits to be one step ahead of their rival firms. Surf With Anonymity If you are using a public proxy service, it will provide you with its own IP address as you travel around the web. So, when the websites try to log your data to their database, they fail to do so. Because your actual IP address is hidden by the proxy’s IP address. Why is it important? Well, your device’s own IP address can tell much information about the user. If your IP address is revealed, this means which city you are in, its area code, ZIP code, the name of your ISP, and the code of your ISP are also revealed. A leak on a website such as Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where users generally do not have local restrictions, so they often do not use public proxy servers, would reveal your and others’ IP addresses to the hackers. Avoid Location-Specific Restrictions Due to the copyright laws and governmental regulations, a considerable amount of the internet is geo-blocked. This means if you connect to the internet at location X, you wouldn’t be able to connect some of the web pages that are banned by location X. However, as public proxies hide your real IP address, web pages cannot see your real location. So, there won’t be any restrictions based on your location’s regulations while using a public proxy service. Moreover, public proxies are also able to avoid connection limitations of a local network of a workplace, a bus station, or a dormitory, etc. Protection Against Malware Public proxy servers can ban users from entering risky web pages that might contain malware. Most of the daily users of the internet do not have a list of potentially dangerous websites that might hurt their devices. Public proxies often have the data of which websites could have risky phishing links, so proxies could prevent users from accessing these websites in the first place before the harm is done.

You can manually request mediation from any of these sites depending on your post-registration needs. As we bought exclusive agents and tested the agents’ geographical locations, we found one of the proxies from Kazakhstan.

However, this service is available at a very high price of $ 5 per proxy per month for proxies worldwide and $ 10 per month per proxy for US-based proxies. The biggest draw for Microleaves is the lack of bandwidth charging which is quite rare for home servers. If you have a fairly steady stream of requests that can spread to a range of ports that have not been counted and need home servers, this may be a service worth seeing. 10. ProxyMesh ProxyMesh Rotating Anonymous HTTP Proxy Website: https://proxymesh.com/ In contrast to an open proxy server, ProxyMesh proxies are only accessible to certified users. If someone tries to log into both the site and the proxies in your account several times in a row, their IP address will be automatically blocked for several hours on each failure.

We store the information you provide to us on a computer system that is in a controlled installation with limited access. Employees only see your data based on knowledge. Each plan has access to an open proxy server with 200 to 1000 open IP proxies. Thousands of open IP proxies are collected and monitored every 15 minutes, so only hundreds pass the test and around 15 IPs are changed every 15 minutes. This open proxy offers a variety of IPs, but these IPs are slower and more error prone. Conclusion Web retrieval allows you to export any type of data you want.

Here is a definitive guide prepared only for your business! Do you want to analyze your targeted websites deeply and surf the web without the hassle of blocking? Then a rotating proxy might be what you need. The main thing a rotating proxy does is create a secure request ID between you and the websites you target. That is, every time you send a request through the search engine while trying to enter a website, a rotating proxy assigns you a new IP. In this way, you can safely browse the site you want. Well, why do you need this? Let’s say right away: To collect data easily, to get to know the market better through datasets! Of course, the most important features of rotating proxies are that they are presented to you with several different IP addresses at the same time. When you want to access different pages with different IDs, or when you want to make yourself untraceable and unblockable, you can easily take advantage of rotating proxies.

Rotating proxies are technologies that make it easier for you to navigate by masquerading as different identities during intensive data collection from websites. When using these technologies, it is necessary to determine how often you want to obtain your IP addresses and automatically change these addresses. This process will mean that even if you are a very large company, you can access any website you want completely anonymously and scrape the site and turn the data into scalable analytics. Geo-restrictions? It totally ends! Traceability and identification? You no longer have to be afraid of it. ‍ A new era begins for digital marketing, competitor analysis, and market analysis. There is now an easier way to extract data from your targeted sites to strategize competitively. What are The Benefits of Rotating Proxies?

So you need to be able to access many sites online, navigate around them without any limits and scrape data. The bad news about this is this: Websites and search engines constantly monitor navigation in order to detect the repetitive suspicious activity of visitors and ban the relevant IP address. If it is noticed that you have made suspicious activities, your IP address will be marked and your requests sent via the browser to log in to the website will be rejected. But what if you use changing IP addresses? This makes you completely unrecognizable. Your computer’s IP address changes every time you access the website thanks to the rotating proxy. In this way, you can easily continue to browse the web and extract data without even noticing that IPs are blocked. Systems that monitor your online activities cannot detect you at all. An excellent option for market analysts in almost any industry. Find and Compare Prices in the Industry In which field do you serve? Businesses are no longer within the boundaries of the neighborhood or city where they are physically located. They exist in a market with competitors scattered all over the developing and expanding world. So, for example, if you are operating a hotel in a tourist area in Spain, a bunch of datasets follows the most competitive pricing policy, which offers a selection advantage according to the season and room characteristics. In what range do your competitors offer prices? What is the price range of your competitors’ most popular room? How do the prices change in which season? What are the lowest and highest price limits in an upper segment and a lower segment? All this information can enable your targeted customer group to choose you, not someone else, because of the price. You cannot do price analysis by looking at room rates on several sites one by one. You have to have real knowledge of the industry. For this, there are web scraping technology and Scrape.do and rotating proxy services. Take the first step into the future.

Yes, you don’t have to spend all your time in the world. Because this monotonous job could be done via a method called web scraping via machine learning. Using web scrapes through a residential proxy, the procedure of data extraction and collection becomes fully automated. And, as most websites have strict limitations on the entrance of specific IP addresses, using a residential proxy makes life easier by avoiding all these restrictions. Folks, here is a GREAT guide for machine learning & web scraping! But What Is Web Scraping – And Why It Matters For Machine Learning? Web scraping is the automated process of obtaining vast amounts of information from throughout the web. Data of the net often consist of unstructured HTML data. After some process, it could be turned into a spreadsheet or a database so that, in the end, it could be used for numerous practices. Why Web Scraping Is A Threshold You don’t have to limit yourself to one method to apply web scraping to get data from the web; it comes with lots of shapes and colors. This technique could be a particular API’s, digital services, or even writing your own code for scraping from the very scratch. Most of the flagships of the web, such as Twitter, Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc., let you have access to their data, and it is in structured format! It is all good, yet the web is an endless ocean. Most of its websites do not allow data collectors to just access their vast number of data, or they just do not have the technology to do otherwise. When that is the case, we stop for a moment and thank heavens as web scraping exists. The method has two parts, and these are the crawler and the scraper . Crawler is an AI mechanism that surfs the web to find that one specific data. A scraper is a unique tool, which is designed to extract data from the web. Based on the complexity and scale of the project, the structure of the scraper could change considerably to mine the data in more accurate and fast means. ‍ How About Residential Proxies and Machine Learning? Residential proxies are the tools that allow people to select a specific place (a city, a country) and use the web in the chosen location. Residential proxies are basically intermediaries protecting people from the limitations of the web. By routing users traffic through a server, residential proxies assign users to an alternative IP and avoid local restrictions. As we mentioned earlier, most of the web have restrictions on the accessibility of their data. Residential proxies save firms and software engineers from these restrictions, which makes proxies a vital organ of the web scraping process of machine learning. And, How Does Web Scraping Work? – Which Software Languages Can It Proceed? Web scrappers can extract all of the data on a specified website or the particular data that is needed. Specifying the data based on what you actually want would speed the web scrapper up so much. For example, you could want to mine data from a local car dealership’s website about 2019’s sale numbers. Still, you might not want to see how much the marketing budget was that year, or you might just eliminate the sales of red cars from that specified year. When it is time to scrape a website, the first thing is to have the URLs. Most of the scrapers instantly load the HTML code. Scrappers with more advanced technologies could have their way into other elements of a website: CSS and Javascript codes. As a result, the scraper gets all the necessary data from the parts of a website and prints those out in the specified format. Often, these are in a CSV file or Excel spreadsheet formal; sometimes, it is a JSON file. Great, Where Do We Use Web Scraping? Most firms, start-ups, engineers, and coders who decide to make their lives easier use web scraping.

Web scraping has many applications in many different areas. Let’s dive into the together.

To understand how their product’s image is going on, marketers do sentiment analysis repeatedly to be up to date. Firms attack social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and personal blogs to use web scraping methods for collecting information on those websites. Such information provides the firm with a profound perception of what people think about their product. Web Scraping In Price Monitoring Today’s competitive environment is a battlefield, and firms take every action to a competitive advantage over other companies. Firms use the web scraping method on the relevant websites to have general data on similar products.

The machine learning method in the price monitoring area focuses on the optimal price to maximize profits. Web Scraping In New Monitoring Have we mentioned how competitive the environment is in today’s business? Media also have a huge impact on trends and the market. And most of the traditional media moved to digital platforms, which means now it is straightforward for machine learning systems to capture related information. Using web scraping, firms create detailed reports on the up-to-date news related to their own firms or competitors. It becomes indispensable for the sectors, such as investment management service providers, heavily dependent on daily news and speculations. Web Scraping In E-mail Marketing Companies attempt to reach out customers in every possible way, and e-mail is a strong ace in their pocket. Firms, using web scraping, obtain e-mail addresses from numerous websites. These websites are predetermined due to the firm’s marketing segmentation.

Crime occurs when users use collected data for illegal intents. Residential Proxies And Web Scraping ‍ That’s Wow, But How Many Webs Scrapes Types Are Out There? Web scrapes could be divided into two based on some criteria. For example, cloud or local web scrapers, pre-built or pre-built web scrapers, browser extensions, or software web scrapers. Cloud Web Scrapers vs. Local Web Scrapers Cloud web scrapers run digitally on virtual platforms called cloud. These servers are often generated by the firms that sell the scraper. This method is helpful in focusing on specific tasks so that computer resources would not be distracted by mining data from websites. Compared to cloud web scrapers, local web scrapers run on the local computer while using the resources which are also local. One drawback of the local web scrapers is that the task has harsh system requirements in CPU and RAM. It could struggle computer, make it slow, and be unable to do any other jobs simultaneously. Self-Built Web Scrapers vs. Pre-Built Web Scrapers Firms, start-ups, and developers having enough advanced knowledge, generally go with self-built web scrapers.

Also, some pre-built web scrapers have quite advanced options to make customizations based on the specific firm’s needs. Browser Extension Web Scrapers vs. Software Web Scrapers Lastly, the little icons popping up at the right top corner of your browser are called browser extensions. Now, we can have our web scrapers in a browser extension form which can be added to the browser. These are easy-to-use and user-friendly products connected to your web browser. Because of that, web extension web scrapers have many limitations compared to others. Most of the advanced features cannot be run on a browser if it is outrunning the limits of your web browser, and these needed advanced features become just a dream. Software web scrapers, contrastingly, do not have limitations as it is not entitled with a web browser. This software could be downloaded and installed online, and it is outside the boundaries of a browser. And obviously, software web scrapers are more complex and have more advanced features than browser web scrapers.

What is Political Data Analysis and What Does It Do? Political data analysis, where you can learn the beliefs of the voters, their demographic structure, and the information of the region where the voters live, is a process that helps you get an idea about the election results by bringing together all the information you have. This analysis method, which also allows you to learn how to improve the election results, is frequently used by politicians. Thanks to political data analysis, it is possible for politicians to easily review political data and understand which messages are most important to the voters of the current party. The more politicians and the campaign team understand the electorate, the easier it is to reach them and achieve a political victory. Packages with data for political data analysis are usually purchased by both party members running the election campaign and people running a different campaign against the election campaign. Data analysts are hired for this data analysis, which is done by both party members and non-partisans and dissidents. Data analysts also create data sets by combining social media analyses, and the data sets are sometimes used in favor of and sometimes against the electoral party. How Is Data Used Strategically? All institutions working as government agencies and the private sector collect tons of publicly available data, this data is valuable information that can be used for the benefit of society, such as census or national causes of death. By examining this data, senior managers working in government institutions can find the events that affect society and public health and create a new policy to eliminate these events or make them better. For example, you can make a prediction about the future census by comparing the current census data with the previous data, and with the help of this estimation, you can produce solutions that will reduce or increase the population. The purpose of using the data is not only to help society and improve the lives of the society. Private sector organizations and businesses can also examine the demographics of the public to find a compelling message that can be used to refine their pricing strategy or the advertising message. Considering that this is a transaction made with the benefit of the business in mind, it is not considered innocent. The Relationship Between Big Data and Political Campaigns The advent of Big Data, in which data is analyzed, classified, and made meaningful, has dramatically changed the course of political campaigns, completely and forever. With Big Data, where even the smallest emoji shared on social media can find its place, many political election campaigns can communicate more directly with the voters. While this form of communication is sometimes personal information such as phone number and address information, sometimes it can be vital and remarkable social messages. Although it has become easier to run political campaigns with Big Data, there are serious questions and debates about whether this situation makes election campaigns and politics better. Some politicians think that focusing on the data presented to them is a big mistake in gaining new voters, while others argue that taking advantage of the data will increase the number of new voters. Regardless of what other people think, and no matter what, if you’re going to run a small election campaign with very few resources, it’s best to use data so you know where to focus. How Can Web Scraping Help Political Campaigns: The Most Popular Applications! Do you want to move forward with analysis for your political election campaigns, but don’t know how to proceed or how to get the data? Don’t worry about it! We have beautifully explained to you four different applications where you can enhance your political campaigns using web scraping. To briefly touch on these ways, we can say choosing to create a strategy by understanding their beliefs and preferences, doing web scraping from time to time, getting information to reach people, and analyzing local elections. Let’s take a closer look at these ways. By Understanding Voter Beliefs and Preferences with Web Scraping, You Can Create a Strategy We all know that people use social media sites to share their political views as they share almost everything. In this case, you can scrape tons of data from social media to find out how your election campaigns are going or what people think of your party. To do this, you can use hashtags and current news on social media platforms. It is also possible to find out what your potential voters think about which political issue by using web scraping. What should you do after determining your target audience with political data? With the data you get with web scraping, you can easily learn what kind of audience your target audience is, and the values, opinions, preferences, and tastes of your voters. Doing so is as simple as scraping data from a social media platform. We know that young people or those who will vote for the first time are more indecisive than other age groups about whom they will vote in the elections, in this case, taking advantage of the platforms where young voters are will take you one step further. You can review the following list we have prepared for you to get an idea: While the young people who will vote are learning information about politics, they follow the updates on social media sites instead of visiting news sites. You can attract their attention by presenting an ad campaign to frequently followed pages. In order to attract the attention of the young audience, you can place online advertisements by contacting social media sites in person. If you want to appear more friendly and approachable to your electorate, you can open social media accounts and contact them frequently through these social media accounts. You can use old social media sites or advertise on news sites to win the hearts of your potential middle-aged voters. For older voters, it would be more appropriate to make an advertising campaign on television or in newspapers.

People tend to go after people who they think understand them and who have high empathy skills. Of course, it is not possible for an election candidate to communicate with everyone and personally show that he understands these people. So how do they do this? Using the election data you get with web scraping, you can easily analyze people’s interests, goals, preferences, and dreams, at least as much as they show on social media. If you want people to come after you, you should find out what their problems are with good analysis and make statements explaining that if you are elected, you will implement policies that will help those people. In this way, you will both win the hearts and support of those people and run a successful election campaign. Note: Make sure you keep your promises if the election campaign is successful. You Can Contact People Using The Contact Information You Obtained With Web Scraping We mentioned that the political data you obtain with web scraping is useful for understanding the personality, demographic structure of the voters, and the situations they describe as problems. However, the data you can obtain with web scraping is not limited to this. You can also get in touch with these people directly by learning their contact information. When communicating directly with people, you should not neglect to use important demographic information of those people (whether they are party members, where they live, their race, or education level). For example, you can approach someone who wants to buy a house but does not have a good enough income to buy a house, with an offer to buy a house at cheaper prices. With the political data you get with web scraping, you can learn what interests your potential voters personally, and by using this information, you can maintain a successful election campaign. We can list the important contact information you can get with web scraping as follows: The voter’s home address and work address The voter’s favorite email address Mobile phone numbers of the voter The voter’s education and employment The primary preferences of the voter as a consumer CV information of the voter such as job title, occupation, and educational background can be learned by scraping LinkedIn pages You Can Predict the Possible Future of Elections with Web Scraping Data Campaigning for national elections can be more difficult than you think, as national elections are a more serious event than local elections. Also, since the election campaigns required for national elections are larger than local election campaigns, larger amounts of data need to be scraped. In this case, it will be more difficult for parties with a very limited budget to analyze data to run their election campaigns. But you can scrape locally using web scraping and organize the analysis by region and then evaluate the regions together to arrive at a rational conclusion. We can easily say that one of the most important uses of the political data you can obtain by using web scraping is to follow the progress of the political election campaigns and to analyze both your own campaign and the rival campaign. So much so that you can find out who is popular at that moment by scraping data from survey sites that organize surveys and publicly share their surveys. You don’t need to be content with only survey sites to find out, you can also scrape social media and news sites. In line with the information you will learn, you can understand which election campaign can win and which campaign will lose as long as it moves in the same direction. You can objectively see the status of your election campaign if you perform this web scraping regularly over a period of time. As the Scrape.do team, in this article, we have explained in detail how you can make progress in political campaigns using web scraping.
